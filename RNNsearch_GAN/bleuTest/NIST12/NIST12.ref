<seg id=1> New Sighting of Massive Bird Deaths, with Carcasses Lying on Street in Sweden </seg>
<seg id=2> While a large number of birds have died for unknown causes in the past week in the southern United States, Swedish officials said as many as 100 birds had fallen today on a snow-covered street in Sweden as well. </seg>
<seg id=3> "Most of them were already dead," Olofsson (Christer Olofsson), a staffer of rescue services in the southwestern Swedish town of Falkoeping (Falkoeping) said of the 50 to 100 jackdaw birds, a type of crow. </seg>
<seg id=4> Ornithologist Wirdheim (Anders Wirdheim) said this discovery was surprising. </seg>
<seg id=5> He told the Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet (Aftonbladet): "This is unusual."  Posted on the website of the tabloid was a photo taken by a reader of flocks of black birds swarming a snow-covered street. </seg>
<seg id=6> Wirdheim said: "They are probably jackdaws, who would spend the winter in large flocks.  If they are disturbed, they may fly themselves aimlessly to death due to excessive stress." </seg>
<seg id=7> Olofsson told AFP that a police patrol first found these birds around midnight and caught five for analysis. </seg>
<seg id=8> Andersson (Olov Andersson) of the National Veterinary Institute (National VeterinaryInstitute) told the Swedish news agency TT that they would analyze the carcasses of the birds and test for bacterial or viral infection, including for new flu. </seg>

<seg id=26> Global Unemployment Rate Sets New High Record, with 200 Million People Jobless </seg>
<seg id=27> The International Labor Organization (The International Labour Organization) warned today that the global economic recovery was not translating into jobs as the world's unemployment remained at a record-breaking 205 million for 2010. </seg>
<seg id=28> The International Labor Organization said: "Despite a significant rebound in economic growth for many countries, official global unemployment data remained at 205 million in 2010, almost unchanged from 2009, and 27.6 million more than on the eve of the global economic crisis in 2007." </seg>
<seg id=29> "The International Labor Organization projects a global unemployment rate of 6.1%, equivalent to 203.3 million unemployed, through 2011." </seg>
<seg id=30> According to the International Labor Organization, about over half of the unemployment occurring since 2007 happened in industrialized economies and the European Union.  Many young people reaching working age have still failed to find jobs. </seg>
<seg id=31> The International Labor Organization found that in developing countries such as Brazil, Kazakhstan (Kazakhstan) and Thailand, jobless rates have already fallen to the levels before the economic crisis. </seg>
<seg id=32> Besides the issue of unemployment, some 1.53 billion people are trapped in "vulnerable employment" such as temporary jobs. </seg>
<seg id=33> In addition, the issue of youth unemployment was also discouraging. Seventy-eight million young people were jobless in 2010, higher than the level of 73.5 million people in 2007 prior to the economic crisis. </seg>

<seg id=56> British Journalist Expelled for Reporting Russia as "Mafia State" </seg>
<seg id=57> British Guardian (Guardian) reported on the 7th that Russia's security services expressly banned the Guardian's Moscow correspondent from entering Russia. </seg>
<seg id=58> The Guardian said that Harding (Luke Harding) reported on the diplomatic contents of the US cables disclosed by the WikiLeaks (WikiLeaks) and described Russia as becoming a "mafia state" (mafia state), resulting in being expelled from the country. </seg>
<seg id=59> A security source told the state-run RIA Novosti agency (RIANovosti) that Harding's name was on a list of undesirable persons and "Harding was not allowed to enter Russian territory on the demand of one of the Russian security units." </seg>
<seg id=60> The source did not specify further but his comment implied that the demand may have come from the Foreign Intelligence Service (Foreign IntelligenceService, SVR) or the Federal Security Service (Federal SecurityService, FSB). </seg>
<seg id=61> The Russian foreign ministry has not yet given an explanation for this incident of expelling the journalist, while the Guardian said that this is believed to be the first case of a British journalist being expelled from Russia since the end of the Cold War. </seg>

<seg id=65> X-rays Reveal the Secret, Explaining Why Van Gogh's Paintings Fade </seg>
<seg id=66> According to a report published in the United States today, scientists in several countries have discovered it is a chemical reaction that has caused the vivid yellows in van Gogh's paintings to fade and turn brown. </seg>
<seg id=67> The research results published in the journal Analytical Chemistry (Analytical Chemistry) indicate that by using a super-sensitive microscopic X-ray, scientists have observed a chemical reaction taking place when the varnish and paints are subject to sunlight which causes the yellow paint to fade. </seg>
<seg id=68> Hendriks (Ella Hendriks) of the Van Gogh Museum Amsterdam (Van Gogh MuseumAmsterdam) said: "This type of advanced research helps us to further understand how paintings fade and age and (the results of research)should be conserved for future generations." </seg>
<seg id=69> The X-ray research conducted at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility) in Grenoble (Grenoble), France also showed a reduction in chromium "was especially prominent in the presence of chemical compounds which contained barium and sulphur." </seg>
<seg id=70> The study said that this observation led scientists to believe that "Van Gogh's painting technique of blending white and yellow paint might be the cause of the darkening of the yellow paint in his paintings." </seg>
<seg id=71> The study authors noted that the best way to prevent artwork from deterioration is to avoid exposure to ultraviolet rays and sunlight. </seg>

<seg id=73> Snow Leopard, Hare, and Polar Bear as Mascots for Winter Olympic Games in Russia </seg>
<seg id=74> A snow leopard, hare, and polar bear have been chosen as the mascots for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games (Winter Olympic Games) which will be held in Sochi (Sochi), a resort destination on the shore of the Black Sea (Black Sea) in southern Russia. </seg>
<seg id=75> The decision on these three mascots was made in a public vote.  Russia's state-run television Channel One (Channel One) announced that a snow leopard, hare, and polar bear were chosen as mascots from a list of nine short-listed entries. </seg>
<seg id=76> The snow leopard collected the highest vote, accounting for 28% of the total votes, but the 2014 Winter Olympic Games Organizing Committee chairman Chernyshenko (DmitryChernyshenko) announced the decision to choose three animals as official mascots. </seg>
<seg id=77> Meanwhile, Sun beam boy (Sun beam boy) and Snowflake girl (Snowflake girl) were chosen as mascots for the 2014 Paralympic Games (Paralympic Games). </seg>
<seg id=78> Russia's Prime Minister Putin (Vladimir Putin) had earlier said that he wanted a funky snow leopard to represent the city of Sochi. </seg>
<seg id=79> While serving as Russia's president, Putin made an indelible contribution to Russia's successful bidding for the right to host the Winter Olympic Games. He remains Russia's de facto leader.  He commented: "A leopard is a kind of animal that exhibits strong, powerful, fast and beautiful features.  The leopard species was extinct in the Caucasus (Caucasus) region, but it is reviving again today." </seg>

<seg id=81> Expert: Cooling Is Key to Averting Release of Radiation </seg>
<seg id=82> The Science Daily (ScienceDaily) website reported today that an American radiation expert said that cooling is the key to averting disaster at the earthquake-hit nuclear power plant in Japan. </seg>
<seg id=83> After its cooling system was damaged by a strong earthquake, the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant (Fukushima No.1), located 250 kilometers northeast of Tokyo, was hit by an explosion today, giving rise to concerns over a possible meltdown of the core of the reactors with potential release of radiation. </seg>
<seg id=84> Director Chesser (Ron Chesser) of the Center of Environmental Radiation Studies (Center of Environmental RadiationStudies) at Texas Tech University (Texas Tech University) was the first American scientist allowed inside the nuclear disaster exclusion zone following the Chernobyl (Chernobyl) nuclear disaster in Ukraine in 1992. </seg>
<seg id=85> Chesser told the Science Daily website in the US: "If Japan is having trouble cooling the reactors, it is going to trigger an emergency." </seg>
<seg id=86> Chesser pointed out that although reports have claimed the nuclear power plant's reactors were shut down safely, the reactors must still be cooled constantly to avoid a meltdown of the core of the reactors. </seg>
<seg id=87> He said: "There are a few particular trigger points that will lead to declaring an emergency at nuclear reactors.  Reduction in cooling capacity would be one of those.  Release of radiation would be another trigger point." </seg>
<seg id=88> Chesser said: "Reactors are not like cars that you can turn off and walk away.  They will continue to generate a great amount of heat until the core is melted.  Without cooling water, then there will be a real chance of a meltdown of core that could result in a large release of radiation." </seg>

<seg id=102> The Centre for Global Energy Studies (Centre for GlobalEnergy Studies) in London warned that the current turmoil is giving rise to market concerns that the 2008 oil price surge up to $147 a barrel will be repeated. </seg>
<seg id=103> The Centre for Global Energy Studies said the oil market needed "a clear unambiguous directive" from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) as to how to make up for the sudden reduction in the Libyan production. </seg>

<seg id=121> China Deals with Disasters of Low Temperature, Rain, Snow and Freeze to Ensure Safe Operation of Southern Power Grid </seg>
<seg id=122> Reporters today learned from the State Electricity Regulatory Commission that the main power networks in Guizhou, Hunan, and other regions, which are considerably affected by rain, snow and freezing weather, have been operating normally as of January 5. </seg>
<seg id=123> In the Guizhou power network, 221 transmission lines are severely covered with ice, resulting in 25 trippings of circuit breakers.  Power transmission has been restored on 19 circuits, and every effort is being made to carry out urgent repairs on the remaining six circuits.  No county in the province has seen power outage due to ice coverage. </seg>
<seg id=124> In Hunan's power network, 184 transmission lines are covered with ice. </seg>
<seg id=125> In addition, nine transmission lines in Guangdong's power network are covered with ice; three transmission lines in Yunnan's power network are covered with ice; 13 transmission lines in Guangxi's power network are covered with ice; and in the southern power network 13 power dispatch tube transmission lines are covered with ice. </seg>
<seg id=126> The ice coverage is without exception within the design support range, and so far is not affecting the normal running of the transmission lines. </seg>
<seg id=127> Also, according to a forecast by the National Meteorological Center of China Meteorological Administration, in the coming week, Guizhou, the western and southern parts of Hunan and the northeast of Guangxi and other regions will see intermittent sleet, mainly between the night of January 5th and the 7th, and from the 9th till the 11th. </seg>

<seg id=131> Work Begins on Kinmen Bridge which Ma Ying-jeou Expects to Become New Maritime Landmark in Taiwan Straits (Picture) (2) </seg>
<seg id=132> Linking up Greater and Lesser Kinmen </seg>
<seg id=133> According to a separate report in Taiwan's United Daily News, a ceremony was held yesterday afternoon to mark the start of construction of the Kinmen Bridge. </seg>
<seg id=134> Ma Ying-jeou said that he is not building the bridge for the elections, but in order to give the people of Kinmen the fair treatment they deserve. </seg>
<seg id=135> In the future, the Kinmen Bridge will become a tourist landmark in the Taiwan Straits. </seg>
<seg id=136> "We need to give the people of Xiamen enough reasons to come to Kinmen for sightseeing, and we also need to give the people of Kinmen enough honor, to make the people of Xiamen come as tourists." </seg>
<seg id=137> The Kinmen Bridge connects Huxia in Jinning township on Greater Kinmen and Houtou in Lieyu township on Lesser Kinmen, with a construction cost of 7.5 billion and an estimated completion date of June 2016. </seg>
<seg id=138> After the bridge is completed, it will only take five minutes to drive from Greater Kinmen to Lesser Kinmen, which could greatly improve the traffic and healthcare issues on Lesser Kinmen, giving a further boost to tourism in Kinmen. </seg>
<seg id=139> But the people of Kinmen had to wait nearly 20 years for this five-minute drive. </seg>
<seg id=140> Ma Ying-jeou, Wu Den-yih, Mao Chi-kuo, and others attended the ceremony marking the beginning of construction yesterday. </seg>
<seg id=141> Ma Ying-jeou said that in the past, Kinmen had been subject to multiple restrictions as a  result of the military-zone nature of the civilian administration and military control, and now that cross-strait relations have become more relaxed, it is high time that the main island of Taiwan helped the offshore islands complete their construction projects and dreams. </seg>
<seg id=142> The Kinmen Bridge represents the hopes of the people of Kinmen, and also represents the main island of Taiwan's giving back to the offshore islands. </seg>
<seg id=143> National Freeway Bureau Director-General Tseng Dar-jen of the Taiwanese Ministry of Transportation and Communications said in a briefing that the construction location of the Kinmen Bridge was designed with 30% of the emphasis on transportation and 70% on sightseeing, with an estimated completion date of 2016. </seg>
<seg id=144> The bridge project includes the approaches at both ends, with a total length of around 5.4 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id=145> The length of the main bridge spanning the sea area is around 4.8 kilometers. </seg>
<seg id=146> The main bridge is an extradosed bridge with five successive towers and a total of six sets of cables suspended from the five towers, four of which sets of cables have a span of 280 meters each, making this currently the extradosed bridge with the longest span in the world. </seg>
<seg id=147> Ethnic-Chinese Doctorate Holder Sues State University of New York for $7.5 million, for Discrimination and Contract Violation </seg>
<seg id=148> China News Service website, January 10 </seg>
<seg id=149> According to a report in the US World Daily, a lawsuit between Jing Zhao, an ethnic-Chinese female scientist who claims to suffer from depression, and the State University of New York, the Research Foundation of the State University of New York and Dr. Olcay Batuman, a doctorate holder in the school's medical center, has already lasted as long as eight years. </seg>
<seg id=150> The othe day, Jing Zhao gave up a $60,000 settlement provided by the other party, and rehired an ethnic-Chinese lawyer. </seg>
<seg id=151> The case will be heard on the 10th in the Brooklyn Federal Court. </seg>
<seg id=152> Jing Zhao has indicated that she has a Ph.D in animal physiology, but her former employer, the SUNY Downstate Medical Center (SUNY Downstate Medical Center), hired her on a low wage that did not reflect her doctoral status and initially signed a three-year work contract with her, which was subsequently indefinitely extended, but dismissed her after she had worked there for nine months on the ground that Jing Zhao reported her unfair treatment at work to the human rights committee. </seg>
<seg id=153> She also claimed that Dr. Olcay Batuman frequently made her work until 2 o'clock in the morning; only gave her a five-minute meal break; was annoyed when she went to the restroom; gave her an excessive workload that left her with no time to go home and had to spend the night in the office; and frequently made fun of the Chinese accent in her English pronunciation. </seg>
<seg id=154> Ming Hai, the lawyer representing Jing Zhao, said she would sue the defendants for racial discrimination, contract violation, retaliatory dismissal, and violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, claiming damages of $7.5 million in addition to punitive damages. </seg>
<seg id=155> Ming Hai said that this case would be heard at 9:30 on the morning of the 7th in Brooklyn Federal Court, with an estimated trial of at least five days. </seg>
<seg id=156> The defendants have not responded to this case. </seg>
<seg id=157> The World Daily has tried to contact Dr. Batuman several times, but her assistant said that she was not in the office and did not know when she would be back. </seg>

<seg id=185> With Chinese Restaurant in Scotland Reporting Attack to Police Ten Times,  Police Delays in Dispatching Police Officers Questioned </seg>
<seg id=186> China News Service website, February 21 </seg>
<seg id=187> According to a report in Britain's UK Chinese Times, a recent survey of residents showed that two large police forces in Scotland did not dispatch officers promptly upon receiving 999 emergency phone calls. </seg>
<seg id=188> One case shows that Hong Kong Experess, a Chinese restaurant in Edinburgh (located in Sighthill), suffered a racist attack by a gang of teenagers. </seg>
<seg id=189> Twenty youths holding baseball bats, golf sticks and snooker rods caused a provocation outside the restaurant door, shouting racist obscenities and throwing bottles at the restaurant. </seg>
<seg id=190> The restaurant owner, Jing Guo (Jing Gu, transliteration), and his wife and two other employees were trapped inside the restaurant. </seg>
<seg id=191> Guo dialed the 999 emergency phone number 10 times, with the result that the Lothian and Borders police force didn't arrive on the scene until one and half hours later. </seg>
<seg id=192> During this time, the telephone switchboard operator told Guo "the police are on their way," but the police were not coming at all. </seg>
<seg id=193> When Mr. Guo phoned the police station for the 10th time, the person on the other end of the line actually said, "I fully understand your situation; don't phone again." </seg>
<seg id=194> The Strathclyde police force has also been severely criticized. </seg>
<seg id=195> Some residents were confronted with criminals wielding knives trying to break in, but after they phoned the police the switchboard operator classified the case as "non-priority," with the result that the police didn't arrive on the scene until 20 minutes later. </seg>
<seg id=196> John McNeil, member of the Police Complaints Commission, has asked the two police forces to make separate apologies to the people involved and has ordered investigations into this case. </seg>
<seg id=197> The local Labor Party judicial affairs spokesman has criticized the Scottish Secretary for Justice, Kenny MacAskill, for failures in his handling of public security. </seg>
<seg id=198> "His description of the state of Scottish justice is totally at variance with that observed by the public." </seg>
<seg id=199> "If people dial the 999 emergency phone number in line with the regulations, an extremely urgent situation is certainly underway, without a shadow of a doubt." </seg>
<seg id=200> A spokesman for the Lothian and Borders police forces said that five police officers dealing with Mr. Guo's incident had accepted "improvement suggestions." </seg>

<seg id=208> Britain to Spend £500,000 on a Happiness Index Survey with Four Questions </seg>
<seg id=209> China News Service website, February 25 </seg>
<seg id=210> According to a report in the British Daily Telegraph, Britain's Office for National Statistics (Office for National Statistics) will in April issue questionnaires to more than 200,000 citizens over the age of 16 across Britain inquiring as to the degree of satisfaction they feel with their lives as well as the degree of anxiety or happiness they feel. </seg>
<seg id=211> The study will focus on many detailed aspects of personal views of happiness, such as marital status, friendship, as well as personal health. </seg>
<seg id=212> According to Britain's Office for National Statistics, the budget for the first stage of the survey will reach £2 million a year, with the budget for the initial survey, which will pose four questions to 200,000 people, reaching £500,000. </seg>
<seg id=213> The British prime minister is convinced the state can play a role in helping citizens "feel better," and said that a successful government, as well as strengthening the national economy, should also increase the people's quality of life. </seg>
<seg id=214> This project has launched Britain's first Happiness Index, following on the heels of a similar proposal by France's President Sarkozy. </seg>
<seg id=215> The questionnaire grades answers on a scale of 0 to 10 and includes the following four questions: </seg>
<seg id=216> - Indicate in general terms your current level of satisfaction with life. </seg>
<seg id=217> - Indicate in general terms how cheerful you felt yesterday. </seg>
<seg id=218> - Indicate in general terms how anxious you felt yesterday. </seg>
<seg id=219> - Indicate in general terms how valuable you feel regarding your own accomplishments. </seg>
<seg id=220> Paul Allin, manager of the Happiness Index project for the Office of National Statistics, said, "In principle, we believe the responses that people give, and will conduct research on this basis." </seg>
<seg id=221> According to researchers, the most appropriate level for the Happiness Index should be 7 or 8 (on a scale of 0 to 10).  Excessively happy people can easily "be cheated" and make "rash" decisions. </seg>

<seg id=287> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, January 1 (Journalist Zhou Wei) </seg>
<seg id=288> A project to digitize China's heritage of oral literature that has been praised as a "grand encyclopedia" of Chinese folk literature was recently launched by the Chinese Folk Literature and Art Society. </seg>
<seg id=289> The project will create China's largest, most comprehensive and most complete digital library of oral folk literature. </seg>
<seg id=290> According to the information given, the project to digitize China's heritage of oral literature will digitally record all the written and pictorial materials of folk literature recorded and gathered by folk literature and arts workers nationwide under the organization of CFLAS over a period of 60 years since its establishment --including written materials in their original forms as well as their memorized forms in folk culture recorded through folk literature and arts surveys in counties (cities, districts, banners) and towns (townships, sums, neighborhoods) all over China, running to 840 million characters-- and will be a database of folk literature with the most concentrated materials of our country's oral literature so far. </seg>
<seg id=291> The project will advance in stages. </seg>
<seg id=292> The first step will be to scientifically categorize works and materials of folk literature currently held by the CFLAS in line with academic norms, and to digitally process all types of works of folk literature, including myths, legends, folk tales, folk songs, epics, sagas, sayings, riddles (including lantern riddles), allegorical sayings, and vocal performances and plays, and set up a database. </seg>
<seg id=293> Completion of this is planned for July 2014. </seg>

<seg id=297> First Day of New Year: More Than 16 Million Yuan in Subsidies Warm Hearts of People in Yushu Disaster Area in Qinghai </seg>
<seg id=298> Xinhua News Agency, Xining, January 1 (Journalist Chen Guozhou) </seg>
<seg id=299> In the dead of winter, how people in the Yushu earthquake disaster area pass the winter and how they welcome in the Chinese New Year is of concern to the people across the country. </seg>
<seg id=300> In line with arrangements made by a special meeting of the State Council, Qinghai province is hurrying to step up its temporary heating subsidies and temporary price support payments for people affected by the disaster living in relief tents in the Yushu earthquake disaster area.  On the first day of the New Year, more than 16 million yuan in subsidies and support payments warmed the hearts of the people in the disaster area. </seg>
<seg id=301> According to our understanding, before the onset of winter in 2010, Qinghai province had already provided heating subsidies to the people affected by the disaster in the Yushu disaster area, and at the end of December also provided temporary price support payments. </seg>
<seg id=302> The increase in the temporary subsidies extended this time has been limited to January through March 2011. </seg>
<seg id=303> The temporary heating subsidies come on top of the originally provided subsidies, providing an additional 2 yuan per person per day in heating subsidies to the 20,000 households and 80,000 people affected by the disaster still currently living in relief tents in the Yushu earthquake disaster area, with 90 days as the maximum period for provision of the subsidies, which, worked out as 180 yuan per person, is equivalent to the provision of a total temporary heating subsidy of 14.4 million yuan.  The recipients of the increased temporary price support payments are the recipients of the urban and rural minimum income guarantee, recipients of the rural five guarantees, and priority recipients of veterans' benefits in Yushu prefecture, a total of 57,635 people, with an additional 10 yuan in temporary price support payments being issued to each person on a monthly basis.  The payments are initially being provided for three months, totaling 1,729,100 yuan. </seg>
<seg id=304> These two items above altogether amount to the provision of 16,129,000 yuan in temporary subsidies. </seg>
<seg id=305> Qinghai province has asked for the temporary heating subsidy and price support payments being provided additionally this time to the Yushu area to be given in full amount into the hands of the people affected by the disaster and people living in straitened circumstances in Yushu before January 10, 2011, in order to ensure that the people affected by the disaster and people living in straitened circumstances in Yushu have heating over the winter and spend an auspicious and peaceful holiday. </seg>

<seg id=404> The Nanhu Art Kindergarten next to the Nanhu Amusement Park, with its beautiful surrounding scenery and high-end facilities within the park, attracts many parents to come and look around, with their kids in tow.  The parking lot is packed with all kinds of high-class cars: BMW, Mercedes, Land Rover etc. are all not few in number. </seg>
<seg id=405> However, the tuition fees of 60,000 yuan per year is way too much to bear.  The kindergarten's tuition fees for one year are equivalent to ten years of university tuition fees. </seg>
<seg id=406> So, what is special/ about this kindergarten? </seg>
<seg id=407> 1. The general manager of the kindergarten, Executive Chairman Kang Zheng of Guangzhou International Economics College, explains that what's special/ about the kindergarten is its foreign languages and arts.  It conducts "elite education." </seg>
<seg id=408> Chief of the park, Ye Xiaoju, explains that the head of this kindergarten is American and that 70% of the teachers are foreigners, coming from several countries such as the USA, UK and the UAE. </seg>
<seg id=409> The nannies here, including the maids who wash clothes, cook meals and mop the floors, are all Filipino maids who can speak foreign languages. </seg>
<seg id=410> Every month, there is a week to promote culture of different countries. </seg>
<seg id=411> "We'll make it so that the children will keep Chinese culture while getting connected to foreign cultures." </seg>
<seg id=412> Studying here ensures that one can be sent to study at primary school in Singapore, accompanied by their parents. </seg>
<seg id=413> The kindergarten is located in a two-story building among the American Story villas and occupies a total area of around 2,000 square meters. </seg>
<seg id=414> 70% of the teachers are foreigners and the cooks and cleaners are all foreigners. </seg>
<seg id=415> 2. Upon graduation, the children must be able to do the six "threes:" upon graduation, the children are able to speak for 30 minutes with a foreigner whom they don't know, play three songs, make three pieces of pottery, dance three dances, sing three songs and paint three paintings. </seg>
<seg id=416> 3. Each year, the children have 80 piano lessons, 40 drawing and dancing lessons and also 20 pottery lessons. </seg>
<seg id=417> The kindergarten is managed by two presidents of the kindergarten respectively of Chinese and foreign nationality.  There are three teachers allocated to each class in addition to six European and American teachers who carry out training.  Thus the little kids can receive a “biliterate and trilingual” cultural influence. </seg>
<seg id=418> In terms of living and wellbeing, they even follow the daily menu designed by nutrition experts.  One nanny keeps a record 24 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id=419> 4. The kindergarten is more like a children's playground as it has been made into a Disney fairytale castle with multi-colored play facilities all around. </seg>
<seg id=420> Inside the kindergarten, apart from a large outdoor toys area, there are various function areas such as the baby's little farmhouse, library, piano room and also the pottery room and the dance room; there's even a rock climbing area, golf course and heated swimming pool. </seg>
<seg id=421> Such "luxurious facilities" make many visiting parents gasp in amazement. </seg>
<seg id=422> The parents can also track their children's education and life through the dozens of webcams installed in the kindergarten. </seg>
<seg id=423> The interior decor is luxurious throughout.  The beds are 1,800 yuan each and the furniture is all top brands. </seg>
<seg id=424> The kindergarten is equipped with a fingerprint recognition system.  The fingerprint is scanned and only if it matches the registered fingerprint can the child be picked up. </seg>
<seg id=425> Letting a small number of people become nobles first – maybe that's nothing wrong.  But, we hope that common people in rural areas can have their own kindergartens.  It's not appropriate for young children to take the public transport back and forth. </seg>
<seg id=426> Why can't we even afford to build kindergartens with our new rural construction and they have to go to the towns?  Furthermore, common people have been forced to go into towns to accompany them in their studies and buy houses.  Who is our education system destroying? </seg>

<seg id=430> For many people, whether or not a person's marriage is happy is of great significance. </seg>
<seg id=431> But a truly happy marriage is not built on a superficial basis. </seg>
<seg id=432> Since the birth of China's modern romance movies and TV drama series, girls have been all made up into princesses; girls have been all made to act like gold diggers. </seg>
<seg id=433> This method has been used to attract ratings.  Or should we say these directors seem to follow suit and only know how to copy each other's topics and styles? </seg>
<seg id=434> In all, with the influence of this kind of movies and television programs, too many Chinese girls' personalities have been unwittingly influenced and twisted. </seg>
<seg id=435> Many girls think that randomly bashing and yelling at their boyfriends or husbands is the norm </seg>
<seg id=436> and think that their husbands are unconditionally at their service.  Men are willing to spend money on their girlfriends.  Only in this way does it show that he loves you.  It forms this kind of wrong values. </seg>
<seg id=437> We have to admit that nowadays some men have also been influenced by this kind of popular trend and have become a slave to women. </seg>
<seg id=438> But most men get rid of their girlfriends or wives because they cannot stand this kind of suffering. </seg>
<seg id=439> This is also the main reason why China's divorce rate is climbing right up. </seg>
<seg id=440> Many couples who would have been well matched break up because of this. </seg>
<seg id=441> Many husbands and wives who would have originally been deeply in love divorce because of this. </seg>
<seg id=442> This is really very tragic. </seg>
<seg id=443> But now, many girls still actually believe naively that to love them only means to be able to forgive their own mistakes unconditionally and to tolerate their own willful indulgence.  If that's the case, this kind of woman is destined for tragedy. </seg>
<seg id=444> You have to know that true happiness and true pleasure are not built on other people's suffering. </seg>
<seg id=445> People are born equal.  No-one has the right to push anyone else around. </seg>
<seg id=446> Not even people with great personalities can unconditionally accept being pushed around by someone else. </seg>
<seg id=447> The essence of people's moods is like a spring.  The more it is squeezed, the greater it explodes. </seg>
<seg id=448> Do as you would be done by. </seg>
<seg id=449> A person who really loves you will frankly tell you your shortcomings and mistakes. </seg>
<seg id=450> If he sees your mistakes and ignores them, then he doesn't really love you. </seg>
<seg id=451> He's just cheating you, playing you.  If a girl is just thinking every day of looking for a guy who cajoles her all day long, then this girl probably won't achieve true happiness. </seg>
<seg id=452> Society is materialistic now.  Most people only seek temporary enjoyment and satisfaction.  Be they men or women, frequent lowly behavior has become the norm. </seg>
<seg id=453> Many men only treat girls as sex objects or breeding tools.  They think that getting girls relies on being able to coax them in and getting what they themselves want is the real aim.  And it is precisely this kind of thinking that has made too many girls gradually lose trust in love. </seg>
<seg id=454> They view many unrealistic things as real things. For example, being well off and being able to coax girls in. </seg>
<seg id=455> Marx once said that a loveless marriage is a disguised form of prostitution. </seg>
<seg id=456> But now, most Chinese marriages are built on materialistic conditions. </seg>
<seg id=457> This is also why so many old men have become as appealing as hot cakes, </seg>
<seg id=458> because old men are well off and old men know how to coax girls in. </seg>
<seg id=459> People have gradually lost the correct definition of love.  True love is not built on coaxing people in.  True love is not because you're attractive, it's not because you have a nice figure. </seg>
<seg id=460> True love is built on mutual attraction, mutual respect, mutual support and caring for each other. </seg>
<seg id=461> And a truly harmonious and perfectly satisfactory marriage is built on the prerequisite of the man and the woman making joint contributions. </seg>
<seg id=462> Whether it's mainly the man taking care of external affairs and mainly the woman taking care of internal affairs, or the man and the woman jointly taking on the necessities for living, they can be together forever only if there is harmony.  People can have a happy life only if they have true love. </seg>
<seg id=463> Voice of America Plans to Cease Chinese Radio Broadcasts and Television Programs </seg>
<seg id=464> Voice of America Plans to Cease Chinese Radio Broadcasts and Television Programs </seg>
<seg id=465> Report from the Deutsche Welle website, February 15 </seg>
<seg id=466> Original Title: Voice of America Plans to Cancel Its Chinese Radio Broadcasts and Television Programs </seg>
<seg id=467> Voice of America will cancel its Mandarin and Cantonese radio broadcasts and television programs, retaining only its Chinese website, and lay off large numbers of employees. </seg>
<seg id=468> On February 14, the American Broadcasting Board of Governors submitted its budget for the 2012 fiscal year to Congress, including the above plan for financial cutbacks. </seg>
<seg id=469> This budget stated that starting from October 1 this year, Voice of America is planning to stop all its Chinese shortwave, medium wave and satellite television programs and to completely cancel broadcasts in Cantonese.  In addition, it is planning to lay off 45 people, 38 of whom will be from the Mandarin section team. </seg>
<seg id=470> Currently, the Voice of America Mandarin section team has a total of 69 employees. </seg>
<seg id=471> This budget by the American Broadcasting Board of Governors was submitted after Obama announced the US Government's budget for the fiscal year 2012. </seg>
<seg id=472> Voice of America is one of the government organizations under the supervision of the American Broadcasting Board of Governors.  Established in 1942, it is one of the most renowned Chinese broadcasting agencies in the world. </seg>
<seg id=473> This decision will mean the end of an era. </seg>
<seg id=474> Taking Public Transport and Biking should Become Standard Criteria for Assessing Leaders </seg>
<seg id=475> Government cars have already become a social malaise for China. </seg>
<seg id=476> Not only government cars have caused congestion, some people riding in government cars flaunt their power and are hated by the common people, causing social instability. </seg>
<seg id=477> Actually, in most cases, government cars are not necessary.  Leading cadres should set a good example by biking or taking the bus to work. </seg>
<seg id=478> Additionally, we should set whether or not they bike or take the bus to work as the common standard criteria for assessing leaders. </seg>
<seg id=479> In developed Western countries, local officials taking buses or biking to work is nothing new. </seg>
<seg id=480> For example, Governor of Massachusetts and Democratic Party presidential candidate Dukakis just takes the Boston subway to work. </seg>
<seg id=481> Former Mayor Bloomberg of New York also used to take public transport. </seg>
<seg id=482> Today, to resolve congestion in London, the mayor leads the way in biking to work. </seg>
<seg id=483> So why not our leading cadres? </seg>
<seg id=484> There are 700,000 government cars in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id=485> If, on average, you count one car for each cadre, that's 700,000 cadres, more than the population of Boston. </seg>
<seg id=486> Too many officials! </seg>
<seg id=487> So many cadres all use government cars; they are not only out of touch with real life, do not know the hardships of the people but have also caused serious congestion in the city. </seg>
<seg id=488> Government cars are a way of separating cadres from the common people and should be abolished in principal. </seg>
<seg id=489> Think about it.  If we set whether or not they take public transportation or bike to work as a standard for assessing cadres, what will happen? </seg>
<seg id=490> It can be said that this is a good way of creating a harmonious society and correcting the one-sided pursuit of GDP growth. </seg>
<seg id=491> If a leading cadre makes it so there are complaints from all sides and severe hatred from the people in the area that they govern, then he or she won't dare to take the bus or bike on the street very easily. </seg>
<seg id=492> The reason that the London mayor can bike on the streets by himself in an ostentatious manner is that the city he governs has basic policing and the common people live and work in peace and will not stop him on his way. </seg>
<seg id=493> If a leading cadre doesn't even dare to appear on the streets or take public transport in the area he governs, what kind of qualification do they have to be an official in this place? </seg>
<seg id=494> From a historical perspective, places where government officials dared to walk freely on the streets were always places which were governed rather well and also more modern places. </seg>
<seg id=495> For example, the autonomous cities or city states in Europe of the Middle Ages were the origin of capitalism, with the most advanced economies and cultures. </seg>
<seg id=496> From Florence, Venice and Bruges to Amsterdam, at least in the golden era, the officials who governed the cities normally interacted with the citizens on the streets, just like fish in water. </seg>
<seg id=497> And this is also the main reason why the citizens trusted the government. </seg>
<seg id=498> Everyone knows very clearly that if officials constantly do things in a perverse way, they simply won't survive in this kind of environment. </seg>
<seg id=499> In fact, this kind of intermingling with people would also stop officials from doing things in a perverse way. </seg>
<seg id=500> This is a good way of fighting corruption. </seg>
<seg id=501> A harmonious society is not just to be talked about.  The key is to do it. </seg>
<seg id=502> How do we do it? </seg>
<seg id=503> Leading cadres should take public transport and bike and should form a relationship with the common people like fish in water. </seg>
<seg id=504> You need to accomplish this first step before other things can be discussed. </seg>
<seg id=505> If leading cadres cannot even get along harmoniously with the common people on the streets or in their daily lives, then how can we possibly have a harmonious society? </seg>
<seg id=506> Greatest New Year Happiness for Old Japanese People </seg>
<seg id=507> Among Chinese travelers who have been to Japan, not only one but many say to me: "Old Japanese people are really hard working.  Either they're driving taxis or they're cleaning hotel rooms or they're security guards for commercial buildings.  They all look really really old and I don't know if they're up to the job but in any case it seems like they put everything into doing their job every day!" </seg>
<seg id=508> Indeed, in Tokyo, you hardly ever see old people in the parks in the early morning walking with the birds or practicing singing like in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id=509> And also, not to mention that old Chinese people like to do some Tai-Chi and things like that in the early morning.  In the eyes of the old Japanese people, this is just plain extravagance! </seg>
<seg id=510> Most of them steer clear of it. </seg>
<seg id=511> Japanese law states that men and women over the age of 75 can all continue to drive but they need to voluntarily affix a red label in the shape of a leaf. </seg>
<seg id=512> Put nicely, this label is called a "red leaf."  Put not so nicely, this label is called a "fallen leaf," equivalent to symbolizing that the old person is going to die soon which is completely jinxing it! </seg>
<seg id=513> According to the statistics, the number of causers of traffic accidents in Japan last year who were over the age of 75 increased by 150% compared with ten years ago, and there are fewer than 35% of the cars which display the "red leaf" label.  Therefore, in order to strengthen traffic management, the National Police Agency of Japan was determined that from June 2008 it would enforce the compulsory display of the "red leaf" label for the old drivers.  Violators would be fined and condemned. </seg>
<seg id=514> But who'd have thought that old Japanese people were so united.  They were firmly opposed to taking issues with the "fallen leaf" label and thought that this radical move was an outrageous insult to their society of respect for elders and was absolutely intolerable! </seg>
<seg id=515> In the end, by Christmas, the National Police Agency of Japan finally changed their minds and revoked the rule for the compulsory affixing of the "red leaf" label, reverting to the principle of voluntary affixing of the label. </seg>
<seg id=516> One old Japanese person said: "You're not forced to stick the label on, it's great!  This is my greatest happiness this year!” </seg>
<seg id=517> After saying this, the old person stepped aggressively on the gas and the car went roaring away as if it took off! </seg>
<seg id=518> The image below is of the "falling leaf" label attached to an old person's car. </seg>
<seg id=519> In fact, had the news not been broken on Christmas night that year that AV idol Ai Ijima had committed suicide, the news that old drivers no longer had to affix the "fallen leaf" label would have dominated a portion of the Japanese media.  But this would never surpass everyone's curiosity towards and shock over a beautiful woman killing herself.  Ultimately, Japanese society isn't too concerned with whether or not old people are happy.  At least they don't seem that concerned. </seg>
<seg id=520> In comparison, for Ai Ijima who was not found until one week after dying, even now, her blog before her death has been completely oversubscribed with a flurry of posts of condolences on the comments board. </seg>
<seg id=521> See Ai Ijima's blog below for details. </seg>

<seg id=523> Beautiful Female Members of Performing Troupe of Nepal Maoists Posted (Picture) </seg>
<seg id=524> The Chinese military has performing troupes.  For example, there are performing troupes at the Air Force Political Department, Navy Political Department, General Political Department and then locally, in each major military region.  The Shenyang Military Region has the frontline troupe, the Jinan Military Region has the vanguard troupe, the Nanjing Military Region has the frontline troupe, the Fuzhou Military Region has the advance-guard troupe, the Beijing Military Region has the comrade-in-arms troupe, the Guangzhou Military Region has the warriors troupe, the Chengdu Military Region has the battle flags troupe, and the Lanzhou Military Region has the combat troupe. </seg>
<seg id=525> It is said that these names were all approved by Chairman Mao which is why they are still used today. </seg>
<seg id=526> The author of this blog, Qin Quanyao, lives in Dengshikou in Dongcheng, Beijing.  When he was attending middle school at No. 25 Middle School, the school's eastern gate faced directly the performing troupe of the Air Force Political Department. </seg>
<seg id=527> Aye, the female members of the performing troupe there were really beautiful.  When they walked, they were like lotus leaves waving in the wind.  Who can say that it's not a beautiful scene on the street. </seg>
<seg id=528> It's just great! </seg>
<seg id=529> Back then, Old Qin once changed the lyric and sang: "The east is red, the sun rises, China's beautiful girls come from the Air Force Political Department. </seg>
<seg id=530> Wherever there are performing troupes, huerheiyou, people really have the best there is." </seg>
<seg id=531> The Nepal Communist Party has militant Maoists, who have created a Chinese-style performing troupe as well. </seg>
<seg id=532> Each time the organization holds a Summary of the General Assembly, an initiation meeting, or an awards ceremony, for the finale, there will be a performance staged on by a performing troupe. </seg>
<seg id=533> The contents of the show are, of course, praises of the organization, praises of the leader, and praises of Prachanda as the Red Sun. </seg>
<seg id=534> Prachanda regards the performance of the troupe very highly.  Before the performance, he often gives guidance in person.  After the performance, he also goes onto the stage to meet them. </seg>
<seg id=535> In this situation, how can it not leave the members of the performing troupe with tears of joy? </seg>
<seg id=536> Just like in China, the female members of the performing troupe are also exceptionally beautiful. </seg>
<seg id=537> They are from all places around Nepal, performing the most characteristic songs and dances.  Of course, they can't do without the Sherpa girls who are similar to those of Tibetan nationality... </seg>
<seg id=538> Order is kept very well when the performance is in progress.  All people maintaining order wear a head figure of Prachanda on their chests. </seg>
<seg id=539> Migrant Workers Searching for Their Children at Zunyi Railway Station </seg>
<seg id=540> They are migrant workers from counties and towns near Zunyi who have come to work.  Their children were all abducted by trafficking gangs within one year and to this day they do not know where they've ended up. </seg>
<seg id=541> They are very determined, saying that even if they do this one thing for their whole life, they will definitely find their children, right until their last breath. </seg>
<seg id=542> We hope that everyone can help pass on the message in the hope that the criminals can be captured as soon as possible and that family members that are separated can be reunited as early as possible. </seg>

<seg id=545> Looking at "Governance by Meritorious Officials' Descendants" in History from the Perspective of Zhou Yafu </seg>
<seg id=546> In Chinese history there are traditionally five stages of governance: governance by meritorious officials, governance by meritorious officials' descendants, governance by virtuous officials, governance by treacherous officials, and governance by sycophant officials. </seg>
<seg id=547> As it is said, this also shows how "the good influence of men of virtue does not last more than five generations." </seg>
<seg id=548> Among these, the sign of governance by meritorious officials' descendants was very prominent even at the start of the Han dynasty. </seg>
<seg id=549> Zhou Yafu is just one of the representative examples. </seg>
<seg id=550> When meritorious officials assisted the highest ranking official in winning sovereignty, their descendants were not necessarily involved (with the exception of the feudalistic dynasties established by such ethnicities as Manchus and Monguls). </seg>
<seg id=551> But, they grew up exactly following the trajectory of the meritorious officials coming into power. </seg>
<seg id=552> This then gives the meritorious officials' descendants quite a lot of practice and extraordinary experience. </seg>
<seg id=553> Zhou Bo led the imperial guards in subduing the imperial Lü family; Zhou Yafu defeated the seven warring states by waiting at ease till his enemies were exhausted.  Neither happened by coincidence. </seg>
<seg id=554> Even the fate of this father and son pair was not coincidental, either. </seg>
<seg id=555> The evolution of the governance by meritorious officials into the governance by the descendants of meritorious officials is historically and politically inevitable for this kind of tradition.  Under normal circumstances, no-one can stop it. </seg>
<seg id=556> So, if one remains calm when seeing strange things, the strangeness will do no harm. </seg>
<seg id=557> However, compared with meritorious officials, the descendants of meritorious officials are a cut below after all. </seg>
<seg id=558> This is exactly because the descendants of meritorious officials, after all, grew up in a background different from that of the meritorious officials. </seg>
<seg id=559> Although they learned certain strengths of the meritorious officials, some of the strengths or experiences were beyond their reach. </seg>
<seg id=560> After all, the descendants of meritorious officials grew up in wealth.  Their awareness of bitterness and hardship was limited only to the oral narration or recollection of their elders.  They did not know it firsthand. </seg>
<seg id=561> Therefore, their understanding of bitterness and hardship which they often preached also stayed more or less on the level of average performance, never amounting to any substantive knowledge. </seg>
<seg id=562> The Xuande Emperor Zhu Zhanji of the Ming dynasty followed his grandfather Zhu Di on several northern expeditions but he didn't even want to try a single mouthful of food made by the common people. </seg>
<seg id=563> (At any rate, his mother still ate two mouthfuls in the name of the Empress Dowager, but Zhu Zhanji wouldn't eat anything). </seg>
<seg id=564> This is the difference. </seg>
<seg id=565> Zhou Bo's imprisonment stemmed from the Emperor's suspicion and distrust.  Zhou Bo himself had not left any evidence of arrogance in the hands of other people. </seg>
<seg id=566> However, we cannot say that Zhou Yafu reaching out to ask for chopsticks from Emperor Jing of Han is not impolite but this is also normal from Zhou Yafu's point of view. </seg>
<seg id=567> In fact, this was also normal in the system of governance by meritorious officials' descendants. </seg>
<seg id=568> Their pride deep down was on constant display and there was no way of feigning it. </seg>
<seg id=569> It should be said that in several segments of time the knowledge and abilities of meritorious officials' descendants were quite outstanding.  Naturally, there were many flaws as well. </seg>
<seg id=570> So, how could the risk of governance by meritorious officials' descendants be avoided? </seg>
<seg id=571> That would be through a democratic system.  This was wishful thinking in the feudalistic era. </seg>
<seg id=572> The advantage of the democratic system is not that it can avoid problems happening but that it can avoid large-scale problems happening as best as possible or that there is still room to undo some of the damage when large-scale problems have happened. </seg>
<seg id=573> However, this is another subject. </seg>
<seg id=574> Comrade Jiang Qing </seg>
<seg id=575> On January 25, 1981, the Special Court at the Supreme People's Court made its judgment through court hearing on 10 principals of the counterrevolutionary clique including Lin Biao and Jiang Qing: </seg>
<seg id=576> Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao were sentenced to death, with a two-year suspension of execution and deprivation of political rights for life; </seg>
<seg id=577> Wang Hongwen was sentenced to life imprisonment, with deprivation of political rights for life; </seg>
<seg id=578> other seven offenders were sentenced to set terms of imprisonment; with twenty years for Yao Wenyuan, eighteen years for Chen Boda, eighteen years for Huang Yongsheng, seventeen years for Wu Faxuan, eighteen years for Li Zuopeng, sixteen years for Qiu huizuo, eighteen years for Jiang Tengjiao, with deprivation of political rights for all of them for five years. </seg>
<seg id=579> Readers' Guide: Why do We Question Shanghai Jiaotong University's Induction of Luc Montagnier? </seg>
<seg id=580> On November 22 last year, the report on Page 12 of the People's Daily that winner of 2008 Nobel Prize for Physiology or Medicine, Luc Montagnier (Luc Montagnier, also translated as Luc Montagnier by someone, see Wikipedia for details), had accepted an invitation from Shanghai Jiaotong University to become the university's chair professor attracted a significant amount of attention as there are few previous cases of Nobel Prize winners being invited to serve as full time professors in China's higher education establishments. </seg>
<seg id=581> Picture in media reports of Montagnier after receiving the Nobel Prize </seg>
<seg id=582> However, this news, which would seem to be something worthy of excitement, has actually caused much criticism and even condemnation in academic and critic circles in the country.  This is because in recent years, this Mr. Montagnier, who in the past had made certain contributions towards AIDS research, has actually veered somewhat slightly off the rails.  For example, his clinical experiments on treatment of autism have been alleged as "non-mainstream" methods of experimentation (see the Nature report) and it is also due to his obsession with the so-called molecular homeopathy.  These are all highly disputed and unratified issues in the scientific research field and have even been said by those in the profession to contain elements of pseudo-science. </seg>
<seg id=583> Following this, Science Magazine (Science) had an exclusive interview with Montagnier himself (which can also be found on "Think of the origins" of the Jiaotong University), using a meaningful title "French Nobelist Escapes 'Intellectual Terror' to Pursue Radical Ideas in China" (French Nobelist Escapes "Intellectual Terror" to Pursue Radical Ideas in China). </seg>
<seg id=584> Clearly, in this interview which cannot be considered complete, Science's editor has already raised a number of questions arising from the point of view of academic standards, yet Montagnier's responses actually failed to provide favorable testimony to dispel or resolve these questions, merely leaving people with far too much "room for imagination." </seg>
<seg id=585> As the issues discussed have actually delved into the details of the experimentation, his status as a Nobel Prize winner also left China's media and common people with a confused understanding of the matter.  We believe that beyond the current voices of questions, an in-depth "thorough observation" needs to be performed to be able to offer a substantial opinion on "what Montagnier is researching" and "how to view his research." </seg>
<seg id=586> Therefore, a few Squirrels from the Science Squirrels Club were first chatting in private and then moving on to a discussion.  They found some new concerns through reading three of his latest papers repeatedly.  Based on this, they jointly completed these two "reviews," "Physics without Discussion of Issues in Detail Is Merely Roguery" and "Surprising Cases in Biology with DNA from Unknown Sources," which discussed the loopholes in Montagnier's experiments and theories from the perspective of different disciplines respectively.  They are being released today and tomorrow in order so as to help all readers and interested parties of the media to analyze the matter. </seg>

<seg id=590> On March 6, 7, and 8, 2011, poet, author and strategic planner Hai Mo and renowned strategic planner Mr. He Xuelin, famous in the world for planning Shi Yuzhu's second rising up, held a super dialogue at the Beijing Intelli Center, lasting three days and three nights. </seg>
<seg id=591> This dialogue comprehensively reflected on and combed through the course of Mr. He Xuelin's 20 years of strategic planning, and the two sides held deep creative and innovative discussions relating to cutting-edge topics such as the status quo, future, opportunities and difficulties for China's strategic planning industry. </seg>
<seg id=592> This "dialogue between Hai and He" was named "the most awesome dialogue between strategic planners in history."  The comprehensiveness of the dialogue, the depth of the language in the dialogue and the length of the dialogue were all record-setting in history. </seg>
<seg id=593> What subject made Hai Mo's facial expression so serious and murderous? </seg>

<seg id=615> In "I Am Number Four," from when Number 3 is killed in the wilderness to the involvement of the Internet, to the legend of extra-terrestrial space, to the high-tech weapons, to the wrestling on American campuses, to the forgery of documents, they have everything... </seg>
<seg id=616> Finding and killing Number Four becomes the main theme of the entire movie, a little like Harry Potter 7 – "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," to protect, like Harry Potter, as the main theme... </seg>
<seg id=617> In "I Am Number Four," there are many guardians protecting Number Four.  This is also like myths and legends.  All in all, in "I Am Number Four," we have already realized the existence of a mission system.  It's more like PK in a super-game... </seg>
<seg id=618> You can spend the weekend watching "I Am Number Four" on weekend.  Although it won't hit the spot as the blockbusters, these battles are already like those in Chinese martial arts movies.  If we were to say that Chinese movies focus on martial arts and Kung Fu, then American movies focus more on the integration of high technology... </seg>
<seg id=619> "I Am Number Four" did not give us a final ending.  Just like Harry Potter 7, there will be the next episode... </seg>
<seg id=620> Time to Place a Big Stake in Mobile Phone Internet Gaming </seg>
<seg id=621> Text/Zhang Shuyue  CEO of Shanda Games, Tan Qunzhao, has said that in addition to the PC platform, Shanda will position itself on the mobile Internet platform. </seg>
<seg id=622> However, up to today, almost all first-tier online gaming companies have suggested similar ideas but no results whatsoever have been seen.  As long as the existing online games continue to cater well to the gamers' taste, no gaming companies will really place a big stake in the mobile Internet gaming. </seg>
<seg id=623> From an overall perspective, online gaming entering the mobile Internet is a very good opportunity, but currently, it remains only at conceptual level. </seg>
<seg id=624> In fact, the idea of online gaming being positioned on the mobile Internet has been around for more than one or two years.  But the key reason why no growth points have been formed is that no point where the two appropriately connect has yet been found: Online games have not yet been really embedded into mobile phones because of restrictions from many factors such as mobile phone model, Internet speed etc. </seg>
<seg id=625> But presently, the industry has still not formed an idea of how to develop this blue ocean. </seg>
<seg id=626> In my opinion, this point where the two connect will be web games.  In other words, the point where web games or online games connect up with mobile terminals is in 2011.  Web games should be able to open up the interface between online games and mobile Internet because web games can be used on mobile Internet on devices such as the ipad and on products such as e-books, laptops, and mobile phones. </seg>
<seg id=627> And, if they are really released to the target group accurately, it will also be more profitable, whether they choose the completely free, advertising-only, or the paid-game model. </seg>
<seg id=628> Moreover, the gaming companies are currently half a beat too slow.  Currently, some online video websites have already started online gaming through the use of web games. </seg>
<seg id=629> Online video websites starting online gaming is actually hoping to find some profit from money-burning videos and a massive number of users by bringing users to web games.  Rather than taking other people's advertisement, it is better to produce your own, because the overall cost of developing web games is actually not high. </seg>
<seg id=630> And, apart from video websites, any platforms with traffic will try operating with web games. </seg>
<seg id=631> Currently, there are already some rather successful cases such as PPS Video On Demand.  It is precisely a good opportunity for video websites to enter. </seg>
<seg id=632> All in all, 2011 is a year of great hope for the online gaming industry. </seg>
<seg id=633> The original reason that the performance of the online gaming industry has slid is not that users are no longer playing games, but that online gaming enterprises have started to focus on research and development.  The online gaming industry will definitely pick up. </seg>
<seg id=634> All text is edited based on the content of my interview with itxinwen.com.  Comments welcome. </seg>
<seg id=635> Are children today less fortunate? </seg>
<seg id=636> I saw a British report on "high quality childhood" yesterday.  The conclusion was that today's children are less fortunate. </seg>
<seg id=637> The reasons are: 1. The divorce rate is higher today; 2. More mothers go out to work today. </seg>
<seg id=638> If these two reasons are really so important, then how are our children gonna get by in life?  How many mothers among us are willing to not work just because of their kids? </seg>
<seg id=639> Pushkin Town (Royal Village)—— French-style Garden </seg>
<seg id=640> Pushkin town is a small town 24 kilometers from St. Petersburg in the southern suburbs and used to be royal territory. </seg>
<seg id=641> In fact, this area encompasses two parts, Alexander Park and Catherine Park. </seg>
<seg id=642> Today, the part of the park mainly consisting of the Catherine Palace is most visited by tourists. </seg>
<seg id=643> On the subject of the Catherine Park, its garden is roughly divided into two parts based on different styles: </seg>
<seg id=644> One is the French-style garden surrounding the palace, both at the front and the back. </seg>
<seg id=645> The other part is an English-style garden around a lake to the southwest of the palace. </seg>
<seg id=646> The main feature of the French garden is that the garden layout is meticulous, neat and orderly.  A symmetrical layout is usually used, including the lawn in front of the palace, the pond, the paths, the way the statues are presented etc. </seg>
<seg id=647> The vegetation in the garden is all carefully selected and cultivated in accordance with artificially created designs.  The flowers and trees are even pruned very neatly, all in a perfect grid pattern and with clear edges and corners, as if all items in the garden are lined up to pay attention to their owner, bowing to their master. </seg>
<seg id=648> The exquisite wrought iron gate outside Catherine Palace  View of the garden from the window of the Catherine Palace  Completely symmetrical layout  Graceful flutist playing in the garden almost all year round  Melodious sound of the flute floats through the air of the elegant garden </seg>
<seg id=649> Cameron Gallery  The Cameron Gallery——a gallery used back then for strolling and viewing scenery.  It is an ancient Greek and Roman building in a meticulous artistic style and is a classic example of a building in the style of European classicism. </seg>
<seg id=650> It was constructed in 1779 and named after its architect Cameron after completion. </seg>
<seg id=651> Architect Charles Cameron is a Scotsman. </seg>
<seg id=652> His works were sincerely loved by the queen for their simple, well balanced form, their prudent and harmonious colors and delicate and elegant decorations. </seg>
<seg id=653> In the slightly slopy royal village, the Cameron Gallery is built in accordance with the landscape.  The entire building has an invigorating atmosphere and is light and airy.  On both sides of the spiraling staircase at the front are decorated with large bronze replicas of statues of Flora (the flower goddess) of ancient Greece and Rome and Hercules (a god of great strength), beautiful and chic. </seg>
<seg id=654> At the side of the ponds are stands where you can rent traditional costumes and have your photograph taken.  After putting on the traditional costume, you instantly return to the 18th century.  The edges of the clear ponds are dotted with statues, permeated with the immense air of classicism. </seg>
<seg id=655> On each side of the symmetrical and neat path in the garden are straight linden trees.  These can be seen everywhere in Russia and their wood has a soft and light quality.  It is the material used to make Matryoshka dolls and other hand-made crafts. </seg>
<seg id=656> The high parts and low parts of the vegetation are commingled together in the garden.  The neatly and orderly lilac flowers are in full bloom.  Trees of this variety grow huge in Russia! </seg>
<seg id=657> (UK) Forcing Employee who Stole £845 to Be Paraded through Streets, Boss Pays £13,000 in Compensation </seg>
<seg id=658> The man forced to wear a sign and paraded through the streets in the above picture is an English man named Mark Gilbert.  The man clutching his arm is his former boss, Simon Cremer. </seg>
<seg id=659> In October 2008, after discovering that his employee had written a company check without permission and cashed it into his own wallet, the angry boss tied up the employee and hung a sign on him saying "THIEF – I stole £845 am on my way to police station" and paraded him through the local streets. </seg>
<seg id=660> In the end, the employee admitted the crime to the police and was released immediately after being warned. </seg>
<seg id=661> But the angry boss was accused of illegal detention.  After a few sessions in court, his only option was to pay £5,000 in compensation and £8,000 in legal fees for an out-of-court settlement. </seg>
<seg id=662> When interviewed by the Daily Telegraph, this boss, who runs a flooring company, was still indignant.  "I think this is absolutely disgusting that he was even able to sue me after he had stolen money from me!  I don't want to give him a penny after what he did.  It really makes me want to throw up.  He's a thief, but I still have to compensate him.  This makes me so angry." </seg>
<seg id=663> Yet, floor installer Mark Gilbert who was paraded around the streets said that he was actually hoping to sue him till the very end of it in order to get more compensation for mental damage.  But he didn't have that much money to file an appeal so he had to accept a £5,000 out-of-court settlement. </seg>
<seg id=664> According to him, he wrote the company check without permission not out of greed for money but because his boss owed him wages which he desperately needed for the holiday.  Therefore, he was just "helping out" his busy boss by writing the check. </seg>
<seg id=665> Since the incident happened, he has moved out of the small town. </seg>
<seg id=666> (Hong Kong) If you always date in McDonald's, then why not simply have a "McWedding?" </seg>
<seg id=667> Hong Kong people now have a new choice for their wedding banquets, that is, going to McDonald's for a "McWedding." </seg>
<seg id=668> In 2011 McDonald's in Hong Kong unveiled its wedding package.  Recently, the first couple has already chosen this novelty wedding in a fast food restaurant. </seg>
<seg id=669> On Valentine's day in 2011, in a McDonald's near Hong Kong's financial district, the entire restaurant was hung full of pink balloons, with a "cake" made of piled-up apple pies placed in the middle.  On top, there was a pile of memorial rings with an M made of crystal. </seg>
<seg id=670> With blessings from their friends and relatives holding McDonald's cold drinks and fast food, Kelvin and Ashley held a unique engagement ceremony. </seg>
<seg id=671> This is the first husband-and-wife-to-be to come since the Hong Kong McDonald's rolled out its wedding meal package.  McDonald's Corporation is very confident in this innovative move and believes that it exactly meets the needs of young Hong Kong people who like to chat and flirt in McDonald's and who think that the traditional wedding venues are too expensive. </seg>
<seg id=672> When interviewed, Shirley Chang, who is in charge of McDonald's in Hong Kong, said: "They dated here (McDonald's), their love grew here, so they choose here for their big day too." </seg>
<seg id=673> The basic price for McDonald's "Warm and Sweet Wedding Meal Package" is 9,999 HKD.  In this meal for which around 12 people can be invited, apart from McDonald's food, it includes wedding presents, invitation cards on which the McDonald's logo Golden Arches are printed and all sorts of decorations in the venue. </seg>
<seg id=674> The newlyweds can also choose to pay a little extra money to rent a balloon wedding dress, balloon corsage, a balloon cake, a large pink McDonald's background etc. </seg>
<seg id=675> This price is indeed very attractive in comparison with the wedding receptions in normal restaurants in Hong Kong, but when considering it must be very hard for the elders in the family to accept, we guess that ultimately, it can only be a place for couples in love who date in McDonald's to get engaged.  It is probably a little difficult for it to really become a place for a wedding ceremony. </seg>
<seg id=676> (US) Special Privileges for Pregnant Women in New York – Park Anywhere and at Any Time for Free </seg>
<seg id=677> Pregnant women who are in New York have something to be happy about.  The New York government is considering passing a law to allow all pregnant women to park anywhere and at any time for free in New York. </seg>
<seg id=678> If this bill proposed by congressman David Greenfield passes, expectant mothers only need to take a doctor's certification to the Department of Transportation to apply for a sticker and they can then park legally in every corner of New York City, even at places labeled "No Parking." </seg>
<seg id=679> And, wherever it is, they do not need to pay parking fees. </seg>
<seg id=680> This privilege will last until one month after their due date (ensuring that women who have reached their due date but have still not given birth can also benefit). </seg>
<seg id=681> Mr. Greenfield proposed this bill as his own wife ran into many parking issues both times she was pregnant. </seg>
<seg id=682> New York is renowned throughout the country for being difficult to park in.  There are many people and few parking spaces and the parking fees are very high. </seg>
<seg id=683> Although every parking lot has a parking space "for expectant mothers only," it is sometimes still difficult to find a space. </seg>
<seg id=684> So, he believes that the government should pass this measure in order to assure that every pregnant woman can park where she likes. </seg>
<seg id=685> Similar laws were already implemented in Georgia and Oklahoma a long time ago, but not yet in New York. </seg>
<seg id=686> The New Yorkers did not, however, agree with this bill one-sidedly.  Many people posted that they disagreed on the website of the New York Times. </seg>
<seg id=687> Some people believe that this is gender discrimination.  Pregnant women are not disabled and they do not need differential treatment. </seg>
<seg id=688> Since they can drive on their own, why should they receive treatment that not even disabled people receive? </seg>
<seg id=689> Parking spaces are a very previous resource in New York.  They can't just be given to pregnant women like this. </seg>
<seg id=690> There are also people who say that since pregnant women need to be looked after, it would be better if the government paid for them to take taxis. </seg>
<seg id=691> In any case, driving is difficult for pregnant women in the first place.  If you want to solve the parking issue, it is better to give them money to take taxis.  In this way, the taxi drivers can help them out by carrying stuff and things like that. </seg>
<seg id=692> Actually, this made me think of China's big debate of "should you give up your seat for old people (or pregnant women) at peak times" in the past. </seg>
<seg id=693> At that time, there were also the arguments on the Internet of "since old people have already retired, why are they squeezing in with the working people" and "if you can't pay for a taxi, then you shouldn't get yourself pregnant." </seg>
<seg id=694> At the end of the day, America's pregnant women being given priority and able to park for free is actually the same as the Chinese giving up their seats to pregnant women.  Do you all think that we should give this kind of special treatment? </seg>
<seg id=695> I cried when I watched the movie "Don Quixote" </seg>
<seg id=696> Evaluating a movie which came out in October last year is indeed a little late, but China rarely has movies which appear in cinemas abroad.  If "Let the Bullets Fly" didn't even fly over to Singapore, then why this movie? </seg>
<seg id=697> I watched this movie on a Singapore airlines plane flying to Japan.  Looking at it from the point of view of the movie itself, this is an absolutely awful 3D movie.  It seemed like the producers were learning how to make 3D movies and not creating anything. </seg>
<seg id=698> Additionally, some very vulgar scenes took the movie further and further away from classic production. </seg>
<seg id=699> However, none of this could cover up the success of this movie's script and less could it conceal the radiance of the great humanity of the movie's character Don Quixote. </seg>
<seg id=700> Particularly at the end of the movie, Don's impassioned speech was actually spoken in such a way that my tears just came rolling down. </seg>
<seg id=701> After having watched this movie, Don Quixote has become my most respected person.  Although he is a fictional character, the kind of move where he almost went crazy to pursue his dreams actually moved me deeply. </seg>
<seg id=702> Since ancient times, most people have been pursuing similar things.  When a person is a maverick and pursues his dreams, they are said to be impractical or even crazy. </seg>
<seg id=703> I think that it's exactly because I have a similar experience that I can cry about it.  I rarely complain because society rarely sympathizes with losers.  I just keep working really hard to prove myself and at the same time I don't give up on my dreams.  Do you know how hard this is? </seg>
<seg id=704> I've decided on a title for my second book as "Around the World in 80 Days," and the sub-title is  temporarily decided as "Don't buy houses, buy dreams," just because I want to tell everyone what a enjoyable thing chasing your dreams is. </seg>
<seg id=705> Just like Stephen Chow said, "Without dreams, humans are no better than salted fish." </seg>
<seg id=706> So, what is your dream?  What was your childhood dream? </seg>
<seg id=707> And what are you doing now? </seg>
<seg id=708> Adam Sandler's movie "Mr. Deeds" asked the same questions. </seg>
<seg id=709> No wonder I also like watching Chow's and Adam's movies. </seg>
<seg id=710> Today, Guo Tao also raised this question, so what would your answer be? </seg>
<seg id=711> At the end of the movie, Sancho actually performs an attack on a windmill.  This ending is even deeper than the original. </seg>
<seg id=712> Let's follow our dreams, even though we'll make a few mistakes. </seg>
<seg id=713> Take a look at my new book on weibo "Travel around the world."  Click here to buy!  To solicit a manuscript, please send a post or use weibo.  When reprinting, please state clearly the author's name, Gudu Chuanling, and the blog address </seg>
<seg id=714> The Management System for Storage of Materials </seg>
<seg id=715> 1. After materials sourced externally (including raw materials and spare parts etcetera sourced externally) arrive, handling personnel from the supply department should complete the "Goods Acceptance Inspection Form" which is quadruplicated. </seg>
<seg id=716> (With the "Goods Acceptance Inspection Form" signed by the warehouse manager, one copy is left on file for the supply department, one copy is given to the inspection department, one copy is passed to the finance department by the goods control Department and one copy is given to the warehouse as a basis for issuing the "Warehouse Entrance Document") </seg>
<seg id=717> After inspecting the objects and checking that they pass according to the product name, specification, quantity, and unit price filled in on the "Goods Acceptance Inspection Form," the warehouse manager signs on the "Goods Acceptance Inspection Form." </seg>
<seg id=718> The warehouse manager completes the "Warehouse Entrance Document" accurately according to the results of the inspection and makes three identical copies.  The delivery person must check the goods against the corresponding items on the "Warehouse Entrance Document" with the warehouse manager and, after confirming there are no errors, sign the "Warehouse Entrance Document," seeing that the goods match the documentation. </seg>
<seg id=719> The warehouse manager makes entries in the Warehouse Physical Commodity accounts on the basis of the properly documented "Goods Acceptance Inspection Form" (the warehouse entrance copy) and the "Goods Entrance Document."  One of the other copies is given to the finance department, and one copy is given to the supply department. </seg>
<seg id=720> 2. For the finished products produced by the enterprise itself to enter the warehouse, it requires the Product Certificate of Quality issued by the quality control department, delivered to the warehouse manager by a specially-assigned person. </seg>
<seg id=721> The warehouse manager completes the "Warehouse Entrance Document" according to the circumstances of the goods entering the warehouse and makes three identical copies. </seg>
<seg id=722> Both parties sign the "Warehouse Entrance Document" after checking with each other that there are no errors. </seg>
<seg id=723> One copy of the signed Warehouse Entrance Document is for the warehouse as the basis for making entries in the Physical Commodity Accounts, one copy is given to the workshop as the basis for calculating the production quantity, and one copy is given to the finance department as the basis for cost calculations and finished product calculations. </seg>
<seg id=724> 3. For materials sourced externally which enter the workshop directly due to production needs, warehouse entrance and warehouse exit formalities should be completed simultaneously in order to reflect the enterprise's material flow volume correctly. </seg>
<seg id=725> 4. For materials left over from the workshop to return to the warehouse, a Material Receipt Form in red characters should be completed in three identical copies and the reason should be explained in detail on the notes section. </seg>
<seg id=726> If materials are returned at the end of the month, then, at the same time as doing the material return formalities, the material receipt formalities for next month should be done. </seg>
<seg id=727> 5. For instances of quantity, quality, specification and type etcetera not matching found during the material acceptance inspection and entrance to the warehouse, the warehouse manager has the right to refuse to perform the warehouse entrance formalities and report it to the supply department, the production department or the enterprise's management for resolution, depending on their procedures. </seg>
<seg id=728> This Sector Leads Indexes Fighting for 3000 </seg>
<seg id=729> Yesterday the indexes fell slightly to close deceptively bullish. </seg>
<seg id=730> The total net outflow of funds from Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets was 9.502 billion yuan, of which the net outflow of funds from institutions was 1.695 billion yuan and the net outflow of funds from individual investors was 7.807 billion yuan. </seg>
<seg id=731> After opening low, the indexes saw a wave of small advances, and after 10:15 had a rapid succession of dives, falling below MA5 and MA10 for a time. </seg>
<seg id=732> However, after falling below 2897 points, the intersection of MA5 and MA10, downstream buyers became active.  An upward climb started at 14:15 in the afternoon, resulting in a deceptively bullish line with a small margin of decline. </seg>
<seg id=733> Today the ideal trends again led to strong gains, breaking out to a new high. </seg>
<seg id=734> If the market closes with mid-sized losses, short-term investments are going to have some trouble. </seg>
<seg id=735> In summary, 3000 points will be reached no matter what. </seg>
<seg id=736> Looking at hot points, yesterday saw a rather quick switch of hot points.  In the morning session, biomedical stocks were making active moves.  We discussed this sector several times before in the daily log.  It always likes to appear active in extraordinary events of index fluctuations, Guangzhou Pharmaceutical advancing to the upper limit for trading and Fengyuan Pharmaceutical reaching the upper limit for trading as discussed in the daily log near MA10. </seg>
<seg id=737> In addition, in the real estate sector discussed in an article before market opening yesterday, some real estate stocks benefiting from the guaranteed housing policy are going strong. </seg>
<seg id=738> We maintain our point of view from yesterday that if the indexes are to reach 3000 points, real estate, finance (banking, securities brokerages, insurance) and non-ferrous metal, etc. must serve as advance troops. </seg>
<seg id=739> How to Operate after Central Bank Raises Interest Rates </seg>
<seg id=740> The People's Bank of China has decided to increase the RMB benchmark loan and deposit interest rates for financial institutions starting from February 9, 2011. </seg>
<seg id=741> The one-year benchmark loan and deposit interest rates for financial institutions are each adjusted upward by 0.25 percentage points. </seg>
<seg id=742> We know that raising interest rates is not directly in response to the stock market but mainly because of inflation. </seg>
<seg id=743> In fact, starting from the first adjustment of deposit reserve funds this year, the clear key tone of the policy has already been given.  At present, the basic rhythm of the policy is: upward adjustment of deposit reserve funds ---- upward adjustment of interest rates ----- continue to upward adjust the reserve funds...Apparently, this has already become the main upward direction. </seg>
<seg id=744> Therefore, if you say now that raising interest rates is the last news beneficial to short selling, you will get laughed at. </seg>
<seg id=745> On today's stock market, the game is getting more and more complicated.  Many earlier rules are obviously no longer applicable to the current stock market, because many policies that are not directly affecting the stock market will have an increasing impact on the stock market.  In addition, the game of stock index futures will also become more complicated. </seg>
<seg id=746> Trading days since the beginning of 2011 must have already made everyone fully realize it is not easy to do trades. </seg>
<seg id=747> So, while doing trades, everyone must think actively and should not just believe in some outdated indexes any more. </seg>
<seg id=748> During the Spring Festival, US stocks kept going up and many traders were expecting to make profits at opening. </seg>
<seg id=749> The main force has also taken out half of the bonuses this afternoon. </seg>
<seg id=750> However, this interest rate hike by the central bank must have made many people want to sing a famous online song.  This song is none other than "Uneasy at Heart." </seg>
<seg id=751> Obviously, now many people must reconsider their operational strategy for tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id=752> The operational strategy for tomorrow is mainly to keep close watch for trading benchmarks. </seg>
<seg id=753> The trading benchmark I set is 2800 points, which in fact is just over one point higher than 2798.96 points at closing.  But, don't look down upon this little bit of an increase, it will directly affect our next trading strategy. </seg>
<seg id=754> If the broader market opens high and goes up breaking through the trading benchmark, then we can gradually consider locking in some profit and getting hold of the bonus first and then determine the next trading benchmark based on the point level at closing. </seg>
<seg id=755> If the broader market opens low, I suggest that you keep watch first and do not hurry to buy in.  When the broader market opens low, our trading strategy for the whole day will mainly be reducing the positions.  In particular if the broader market is running below the trading benchmark most of the time, we must be even more cautious. </seg>
<seg id=756> We can consider buying only when the broader market can open low and go up steadily and even break through the trading benchmark. </seg>
<seg id=757> The strategy for operating the positions is very complicated and there are also many details.  I suggest that everyone thinks about it carefully based on the market details.  Tomorrow's broader market resistance position: 2805, 2835 points.  Defending position: 2765, 2735 points.  Trading benchmark: 2800 points. </seg>
<seg id=758> 3000 Points Is Time to Wake up </seg>
<seg id=759> In the morning session, the Shanghai Index fluctuated at low levels after opening, indicating a slight lack of confidence in breaking out to 3000 points. </seg>
<seg id=760> After 10:00, the broader market absorbed a small fluctuation and became profitable.  At this moment, the market moving structure is already in a good state.  Technically, stock indexes are already poised for an upward climb and the transaction volume also supports the continued climb of the broader market. </seg>
<seg id=761> The corresponding index moving trend is also very beneficial to bullish buyers. </seg>
<seg id=762> Based on historical experience, once an upward breakout is validated and confirmed, there will be a round of trends of mid-to-large grades. </seg>
<seg id=763> As the current stage is being determined, the market will become rather vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id=764> After forming a small head and shoulders bottom, the upper resistance comes from the downtrend resistance line formed over the past two years, namely, the line connecting 3478 points and 3186 points, which is also the upper resistance line of the large symmetrical triangle formed in the past two years.  It is currently near the 3100 points. </seg>
<seg id=765> In terms of the market situation, following a sharp rise in coal and non-ferrous metals, the momentum is picked up by banking and real estate stocks.  Undervalued blue chips take turns going up, increasing the evaluation mean of the stock indexes. </seg>
<seg id=766> Real estate stocks are going strong today as a sharp increase in Vanke's net profit infuses life into the real estate sector, while the coal sector, which rose sharply yesterday, registers a clear division today.  China Shenhua opens high but goes low, and other coal stocks have showed a varying degree of decline.  Meanwhile, quite a few traders in the sector have exited by selling off and cashing out, which reflects the short-lived patience of investors holding positions in the sector. </seg>
<seg id=767> But after we have seen the strength of stock indexes, we should also see some adverse factors such as banking and real estate stocks suffering constantly from adjustment.  The certainty of first quarter reports and the uncertainty of the future have led to a rather big market controversy concerning the two sectors, which will also restrict their room for going up. </seg>
<seg id=768> Although no new monetary policy came out last weekend, the funds outstanding for foreign exchange have risen sharply.  It is highly likely that the deposit reserve ratio will be adjusted upward again this weekend. </seg>
<seg id=769> According to today's media reports, the average price of the commodity housing in Shanghai has fallen below 20,000 yuan to a new 32-week low, returning to the level of July of last year. </seg>
<seg id=770> Due to the decline in transaction volume caused by the housing price game, the rebound in the evaluation thanks to the handsome first quarter reports of real estate stocks will be significantly discounted. </seg>
<seg id=771> After a streak of sharp rises, we should be constantly cautious.  While holding our positions and waiting for them to rise, we should also be prepared to reduce our positions at the same time.  Once the breakout fails to materialize, we should promptly reduce our positions to avoid systemic risks! </seg>

<seg id=773> Can Today's Broader Market Drag out A Long Bullish Line? </seg>
<seg id=774> Good noontime, everyone.  The action of selling off in today's morning session must have scared some investors, but it was actually fake and this blogger has already analyzed this point.  The broader market won't nosedive, and rebound will be the main direction. </seg>
<seg id=775> After that, the broader market, led by a group of news-hyped stocks such as agriculture, water conservation, and computer stocks, start to warm up again.  Of course, the real reason driving the broader market rally is still the decline-resistant effect of finance and real estate stocks.  After all, it is impossible to depend on news-hyped stocks alone for driving the broader market rally.  The broader market stocks still need to serve as the basis.  Faced with such circumstances, naturally the individual stock sectors in the market are now warming up across the board, with seventy percent of individual stocks starting to turn positive. </seg>
<seg id=776> After the broader market rallied earlier for five trading days, it naturally should be wash trading back and forth at the upper level of this round of down trends, which is the Shanghai index MA30. </seg>
<seg id=777> Yesterday, an upper shadow bearish line appeared, and today stocks stopped declining and rallied, making a recovery.  From the perspective of the K line theory, this indeed is the K line combination of stopping the decline and staying stable.  Although I also think that right now the broader market still needs time for repeated </seg>
<seg id=778> fluctuations before making a rebound, I am still very much looking forward to the sign of short-term cessation of the decline.  Investors can continue to make observations.  I said that the broader market couldn't be too bad after all, and the focus is on individual stocks. </seg>
<seg id=779> Today, the overall market still demonstrates a sign of collective warming up.  Agriculture stocks are again flexing their muscles, and individual computer and industrial stocks are starting to go strong.  The rate of individual stocks bearing the forefront when the two stock markets fell was also below 4%, an obvious feature of a strong market. </seg>
<seg id=780> I suggest that investors may continue to pay attention to the trends of pharmaceutical and agricultural stocks.  The brisk rallies on these two days are mainly due to their anti-inflation effect, plus the sufficient adjustment earlier.  However, regarding the sustainability, it remains to be seen. </seg>
<seg id=781> The current situation is that individual stocks are active while the broader market serves as the basis.  The focus of investors' operation should still be on individual stocks, and these individual stocks should not be traded just because of an oversold bounce. </seg>
<seg id=782> Please remember one point.  Don't think that the individual stocks that were oversold earlier will have a greater probability of rebound and strength.  This completely belongs to personal wishes.  Based on my experience, China's stock market is simply a main force market.  The strong stay strong and the weak stay weak.  Whether a stock is good or bad does not depend on how the trend and performance on the surface are.  The key is to see if there are main forces and whether or not the main forces will be willing to pull them up.  Of course, this kind of main force will be more willing to pull up individual stocks backed by performance.  This point is the standard for us to pick up stocks. </seg>
<seg id=783> After rallying in the morning, there is a good chance that the broader market's trend in the afternoon will be maintaining fluctuations while going up or going through strong fluctuations.  Of course, the possibility that the broader market may see a mid-to-long bullish line today is not to be ruled out either and can be looked forward to!  That's all for the noontime commentary.  Wish everyone good luck </seg>
<seg id=784> Low Point before Second Rally to Start from Here </seg>
<seg id=785> Reminder: this writer does not have the qualification for securities investment consultation and is not engaged in related business! </seg>
<seg id=786> The blog includes a live analytical commentary on the broader market and individual stocks, which is only the display of personal research results for personal entertainment.  Investors should never conduct corresponding operations based on the writer's judgment only! </seg>
<seg id=787> The individual stocks mentioned in the blog as well as the individual stocks in the tech stocks and funds stocks pools are only to be used by this writer personally for tracking and research, not for individual stock recommendation! </seg>
<seg id=788> One sentence highlighting the topic: Low Point before Second Rally to Start from Here  Against the backdrop of rising overseas stock markets following the festival, the trend of bearish opening must have greatly disappointed many investors.  Before the festival, this writer repeatedly stressed around 2800 that if this resistance was not broken through, it was better for those conservatives to hold their funds while spending the festival.  Reality has proven this way of thinking was correct. </seg>
<seg id=789> Now that readjustment has started, which position will it be readjusted to? </seg>
<seg id=790> In this writer's opinion, for the Shanghai stock market, take a look at around MA10 first; and for the Shenzhen stock market, take a look at around MA20.  Timewise, the remaining two trading days of this week will both basically focus on adjustment.  Also, following readjustment, the second rally requires an increase in transaction volume so that the capacity of the first rally and the capacity of the second rally can form a stepwise moving trend.  Otherwise, if there is no increase in transaction volume and no capacity is formed for a stepwise uptrend, then there will be no need to talk about the second index rally and furthermore there will be no need to talk about the formation of a breakout regarding the above concentrated moving average resistance.  Therefore, the capacity of the second rally must surpass the capacity on January 27, that is, over 110 billion. </seg>
<seg id=791> In terms of sectors, it is necessary to immediately finish up with and mainly avoid the high speed rail and water conservation stocks that have recently soared again and again.  These two major sectors have basically come close to the end of their rallies.  Also, after readjustment, it is imperative to pay attention to any possible formation of new hot sectors.  Only when new hot sectors come out in turn can subsequent market conditions have a greater momentum for driving up the indexes.  It is estimated that the indexes will form a new trough before a rally near the Shanghai stock market MA10.  The low point in the market may materialize on Friday at the fastest or not materialize until next week at the slowest.  Just need to be patient and wait.  See the technical analysis below for more. </seg>
<seg id=792> Technical Analysis: In the previous period, it looked like the main force on the platform from 2564 to 2700 would have major moves.  The extent of the indexes from 2661 to 2800 met this expectation.  So, for the location of the second back dip, look first at around MA10 and then look at around the front and low part of 2661.  Operational strategy: Wait patiently till the back dip is in place. </seg>

<seg id=796> Youling Gongzi: "No Regrets" Where People Want to Live and Die Together </seg>
<seg id=797> I seldom watch TV drama series, and most of time I read books and study stocks.  I watch TV drama series only when they are exceptionally good. </seg>
<seg id=798> A while ago, I watched "Invisible General" and was extremely amazed by the belief in love and the Party's cause in it... </seg>
<seg id=799> After that, I haven't watched any better drama series for a long time.. </seg>
<seg id=800> Last week, a client left a message to me: Gongzi, I recommend that you watch "No Regrets."  I didn't pay attention because I had to do the live broadcast. </seg>
<seg id=801> It turned out another client recommended that I watch this.  I thought at the time that this TV series seemed to be very popular. </seg>
<seg id=802> It turned out a third client also left a message to me, saying, Gongzi, you must watch this movie.  It is more interesting to watch than "Invisible General" and is more touching... </seg>
<seg id=803> In one week, three clients recommended that I watch the same movie.  This is something that has never happened before. </seg>
<seg id=804> Then, I didn't go to the swimming center in the evening and went to a nearby video store to buy this CD. </seg>
<seg id=805> Normally when I go to a video store, I always roam around and like to walk around the sections of horror movies and cartoons most. </seg>
<seg id=806> An old man soon to be 30 still likes to watch cartoons... I guess those reading this blog would laugh to death. </seg>
<seg id=807> I just can't help it.  Everyone has their own aspiration, haha. </seg>
<seg id=808> I asked the store owner if there was any good movie to recommend.  It turned out this one also got recommended.  Speechless... </seg>
<seg id=809> Since so many people recommend that I watch this, then I will just watch it. </seg>
<seg id=810> As a result, this week saw me watching the movie in total oblivion of passage of time.  I slept especially poorly with my mind full of the scenes and plots in the drama. </seg>
<seg id=811> The heroine, Miss Kau, is really moving. </seg>
<seg id=812> Such a woman may indeed only exist in heaven and rarely appear in this world... </seg>
<seg id=813> Especially the grand finale... I watched till my heart was broken and tears came to my eyes. </seg>
<seg id=814> Too much engrossed in the drama, that's all... in the blog on "Invisible General" I wrote last time, (you will know it just by finding out my previous blog), I also wrote about my afterthoughts. </seg>
<seg id=815> But for this movie, I have too many afterthoughts to start writing with and I ended up with nothing to write about instead. </seg>
<seg id=816> If you want to see what friendship between friends is, what family relationship is, and what true and lasting love is, then watch this movie. </seg>

<seg id=1> Another bird flock dies suddenly, carcasses cover Swedish street </seg>
<seg id=2> In a week with unexplained massive bird deaths in the southern United States, Swedish officials say up to 100 birds also plummeted today into a snow-covered street in Sweden. </seg>
<seg id=3> "Most were dead," Christer Olofsson, an official with rescue services in Falkoeping in southwestern Sweden, said of the 50-100 jackdaws, a type of crow. </seg>
<seg id=4> Ornithologist Anders Wirdheim said that discovery was surprising. </seg>
<seg id=5> He told the Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet:"This is unusual."The newpaper's website posted a reader's photo of an entire flock of black birds covering a snow-covered street. </seg>
<seg id=6> Wirdheim said, "They could be jackdaws. They spend the winter in flocks. If they are disturbed, they can become overstressed and fly themselves to death." </seg>
<seg id=7> Olofsson told AFP the birds were initially discovered by a police patrol around midnight and five were taken in for examination. </seg>
<seg id=8> Olov Andersson of the National Veterinary Institute told the Swedish news agency TT they would analyse the carcasses of the birds and test them for bacterial and viral infection, including for swine flu. </seg>

<seg id=16> Princess Diana's Wedding Cake Sold After 30 Years </seg>
<seg id=17> A shriveled 30-year-old piece of cake said to be from the wedding of Britain's Prince Charles and Princess Diana has sold for NZ$380 (US$290) on a New Zealand auction website. </seg>
<seg id=18> A woman named Katrina Greenslade from Christchurch, New Zealand auctioned the cake with royal history on the website Trade Me. She claimed the slice of cake had been kept in her family since 1981. </seg>
<seg id=19> The piece of cake attracted 40,000 hits to the auction site. In the end, "Paul" beat the numerous other bidders for the cake. </seg>
<seg id=20> Greenslade said the morsel of cake originally belonged to her father, who at the time was a sergeant in the Royal New Zealand Air Force. </seg>
<seg id=21> After Princess Diana's ill-fated marriage in July 1981, one tier of the royal wedding cake was sent to air force. </seg>
<seg id=22> Greenslade said, "I want to share this story. The icing on the cake will go to another wonderful home. I hope this slice of cake will become the website's most memorable auction item." </seg>
<seg id=23> The auction attracted dozens of online comments, including one browser who wrote:"Who would have predicted that this slice of cake would actually last longer than Princess Diana?" </seg>
<seg id=24> Another net friend suggested the slice of cake should be sent to the upcoming wedding of Britain's Prince William and his fiancee Kate Middleton. </seg>

<seg id=26> Global Unemployment Rate Hits Record High of 200 Million Jobless </seg>
<seg id=27> The International Labour Organization warned today that the global economic recovery had not yet resulted in job opportunities as global unemployment remained at a record 205 million in 2010. </seg>
<seg id=28> The International Labour Organization said, "Despite a sharp rebound in economic growth in many countries, the official number of global unemployed still stood at 205 million in 2010, practically unchanged from 2009 and 27.6 million more than on the eve of the global economic crisis in 2007." </seg>
<seg id=29> "The International Labour Organization predicts a global unemployment rate of 6.1%, equivalent to 203.3 million jobless to 2011." </seg>
<seg id=30> According to the International Labour Organization, over half of the unemployment since 2007 has occurred in industrialized economies and the European Union. Many young people reaching working age have been unable to find work. </seg>
<seg id=31> The International Labour Organization found jobless rates in developing countries such as Brazil, Kazakhstan and Thailand had fallen to pre-economic crisis levels." </seg>
<seg id=32> Besides the unemployment problem, approximately 1.53 billion people are stuck in "vulnerable employment" such as temporary jobs. </seg>
<seg id=33> Furthermore, the youth unemployment problem is also disheartening.  In 2010, the number of unemployed youth reached 78 million, up from the pre-economic crisis level of 73.5 million in 2007. </seg>

<seg id=56> British journalist expelled after reporting Russia a "mafia state" </seg>
<seg id=57> Britain's Guardian reported on the 7th that Russia's security service had specifically banned the Guardian's Moscow correspondent from entering Russia. </seg>
<seg id=58> The Guardian said Luke Harding had reported on the contents of US diplomatic cables revealed by Wikileaks and describing Russia as having become a "mafia state", and as a result he was expelled from the country. </seg>
<seg id=59> "On the demand of a Russian security service, Harding was not allowed to enter Russian territory," a security source told state-run news agency RIA Novosti, adding that Harding's name had been added to a list of undesirable persons. </seg>
<seg id=60> The source did not specify further, but its comment indicates the demand may have come from the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) or the Federal Security Service (FSB). </seg>
<seg id=61> The Russian foreign ministry has yet to give an explanation for the expulsion of the journalist, but the Guardian said it is believed to be the first expulsion of a British journalist from Russia since the end of the Cold War. </seg>
<seg id=62> Harding had stayed in London for two months reporting on the contents of the US diplomatic cables revealed by Wikileaks. He flew back to Moscow on the weekend. </seg>

<seg id=66> According to a report issued today in the US, scientists from several countries have discovered that it is chemical reaction that causes Van Gogh's vivid yellow paintings to fade to brown. </seg>
<seg id=67> Scientists using a super-sensitive microscopic x-ray observed that the varnish and paint are affected by sunlight, which produces a chemical reaction and results in fading of the yellow paint, said the findings in the journal Analytical Chemistry. </seg>
<seg id=68> "This type of cutting edge research is helpful to advancing our knowledge of how paintings fade and age, and the results of the research should be kept for future generations , said Ella Hendricks of the Van Gogh Museum in Amsterdam. </seg>
<seg id=69> X-ray research using the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France shows that a reduction in chromium "was expecially evident in the presence of chemical compounds that contained barium and sulpher. </seg>
<seg id=70> The study thinks that this observation conclusion will lead scientists to believe, "Van Gogh's technique of blending white and yellow paint might be the cause of the darkening of the yellow paint in his paintings." </seg>

<seg id=81> Expert: Cooling key to preventing radiation leak </seg>
<seg id=82> The website of Science Daily reported today that an American radiation expert has stated cooling is key to preventing disaster at the earthquake-damaged Japanese nuclear power plant. </seg>
<seg id=83> Following damage to the cooling system by the powerful earthquake, an explosion occurred today at the Fukushima No. 1 Nuclear Plant 250 km northeast of Tokyo, causing concern of a meltdown of the reactor core and leaking radiation. </seg>
<seg id=84> Ron Chesser, director for the Center of Environmental Studies at Texas Tech University, was the first American scientist allowed to enter the nuclear disaster exclusion zone in 1992 after the Chernobyl nuclear disaster in Ukraine. </seg>
<seg id=85> Chesser told the website of Science Daily, "If Japan encounters trouble cooling the reactors, it's going to trigger an emergency." </seg>
<seg id=86> Chesser said that though reports have stated the reactors were shut down safely, the reactors still need to be cooled constantly to avoid a meltdown of the core. </seg>
<seg id=87> He said, "There are specific trigger points for declaring an emergency at nuclear reactors. Reduction of cooling capacity is one of them. Release of radiation is a trigger." </seg>
<seg id=88> Chesser said, "Reactors are not like cars, which you can turn off and walk away from. They continue generating a large amount of heat until the core is disassembled. Without cooling water, there is a real possibility of a meltdown that could result in a large amount of radiation being released." </seg>

<seg id=98> Libya's political turmoil continues to affect market and investor sentiment, causing the price of oil to rise in Asian trade today, analysts said. </seg>
<seg id=99> The price of New York's main international crude future, light sweet crude for delivery in April, rose 30 cents to 102.63 per barrel. Brent North Sea crude futures for delivery in May rose 43 cents to 115.39 per barrel. </seg>

<seg id=106> Deceased beauty and US screen legend "Jade Lady" Elizabeth Taylor was smiling to the very last:she was buried a day after her death at age 79, but the ceremony was exactly 15 minutes behind schedule, as she had ordered. </seg>
<seg id=107> The Hollywood legend was buried at the Forest Lawn Cemetery outside Los Angeles. Less than two years ago, it was here that the Jade Lady attended the funeral of her long-time friend, the pop icon Michael Jackson. </seg>
<seg id=108> After the private funeral concluded, the Jade Lady's publicist said through a statement, "The service was originally scheduled to begin at 2 PM, but at Miss Elizabeth Taylor's request it started late". </seg>
<seg id=109> "Prior to her death, Miss Elizabeth Taylor instructed that the service should begin at least 15 minutes later than publicly scheduled with the announcement 'She wanted to arrive late even for her own funeral.'" </seg>

<seg id=131> Work starts on Jinmen Bridge, Ma Ying-jeou expects it to become new maritime landmark for both shores (image) (2) </seg>
<seg id=132> It will connect Lesser and Greater Jinmen. </seg>
<seg id=133> A groundbreaking ceremony for the Jinmen Bridge was held yesterday afternoon, reported Taiwan's United Daily News. </seg>
<seg id=134> Ma Ying-jeou said he was not building the bridge because of the election, but to give justice to the people of Jinmen. </seg>
<seg id=135> Jinmen Bridge will become a future sightseeing landmark for both sides of the strait. </seg>
<seg id=136> "We have to give the people of Xiamen sufficient reason to come to Jinmen to sight-see. We also have to give the people of Jinmen sufficient glory to have the people of Xiamen travel here." </seg>
<seg id=137> The Jinmen Bridge will connect Huhsia in Greater Jinmen's Jinning Township to Houtou in Lesser Jinmen's Lieyu Township at a construction cost of 7.5 billion, with estimated completion in June 2016. </seg>

<seg id=141> Ma Ying-jeou said Jinmen had endured heavy restrictions in the past, including the war zone civil administration and military control, so now that relations across the straits have eased, it was time for the main island to help the off-shore islands achieve their construction and dreams. </seg>
<seg id=142> The Jinmen Bridge represents the hope of the people of Jinmen. It also represents the main island's way to give back to the off-shore islands. </seg>
<seg id=143> The construction of Jinmen Bridge was designed to be "three parts transportation, seven parts sightseeing" and would be completed in 2016, said a bulletin by Tseng Da-ren, director-general of the Taiwan Area National Expressway Engineering Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation and Communications. </seg>

<seg id=147> Chinese doctress sues SUNY for discrimination and breech of contract, asks 7.5 million </seg>
<seg id=148> Chinanews.com, January 10 </seg>
<seg id=149> According to a report by the US paper the World Journal, the lawsuit by ethnic-Chinese female scientist Zhao Jing, who claims to be suffering depression, against  the State University of New York (SUNY), the Research Foundation of SUNY, and the school's medical center academic, Dr. Olcay Batuman, has already gone on for eight years. </seg>
<seg id=150> Recently, Zhao Jing gave up the $60,000 provided by the other side under the terms of a settlement and rehired an ethnic Chinese lawyer. </seg>
<seg id=151> The case will be heard on the 10th at the Brooklyn Federal Courthouse. </seg>
<seg id=152> Zhao Jing said she possesses a Ph.D. in animal physiology and that her former employer, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, hired her for a low salary that was incommensurate with the Ph.D. level.  After initially signing a three-year employment contract with her, the school extended the contract for an indefinite term. However, after she had worked for nine months, the school dismissed her, the reason being that Zhao Jing had reported to the human rights committee that she has received unequal treatment during her work. </seg>
<seg id=153> She also claimed Dr. Olcay Batuman often ordered her to work until two in the morning, only gave her five minutes to eat, became angry if she saw Zhao go to the washroom to wash her hands, put so much work pressure on Zhao that she didn't have time to go home and had no choice by to spend the night at work, and frequently laughed at for her Chinese-accented English. </seg>
<seg id=154> Hai Ming, the lawyer representing Zhao Jing, said he will sue the accused for racial discrimination, breach of contract, retaliatory termination, violation of Article 7 of the Civil Rights Act and other charges, and will seek damages of $7.5 million as well as punitive damages. </seg>
<seg id=155> Hai Ming said hearing of the case will start at 9:30 AM on the 7th at the Brooklyn Federal Courthouse. He predicts the proceedings will last at least five days. </seg>
<seg id=156> The defendant did not respond to questions regarding the case. </seg>
<seg id=157> The World Journal contacted Dr. Batuman several times, but her assistant said she was not in her office and was not sure when she would return. </seg>

<seg id=186> Chinanews.com, February 21 </seg>
<seg id=187> According to a report in Britain's UKChinese, a recent survey of residents showed Scotland's two large police forces do not promptly arrive after receiving 999 police report calls. </seg>
<seg id=188> In one case, a Chinese restaurant in Edinburgh, the Hong Kong Express (located in Sighthill), suffered a racist attack by a youth gang. </seg>
<seg id=189> Twenty youth brandishing baseball bats, golf clubs and snooker cues besieged the restaurant, yelling racist abuse and throwing bottles at the restaurant. </seg>
<seg id=190> The restaurant owner Guo Jing (Jing Gu, transliterated), his wife and two employees were trapped in the shop. </seg>
<seg id=191> Guo dialed the 999 emergency police number ten times, with the result that a team from the Lothian and Borders district police didn't arrive on the scene until an hour and a half later. </seg>
<seg id=192> During that time, operators told Guo "the police are on their way", but the police simply didn't arrive. </seg>
<seg id=193> When Mr. Guo called the police station for the tenth time, the person on the other end of the line actually told him, "I am fully aware of your situation. Don't call again." </seg>
<seg id=194> The Strathclyde police force has also been sharply criticized. </seg>
<seg id=195> A resident whose door was being forced open by a culprit with a knife called the emergency number, but the operator listed the case as "non-priority", so police didn't arrive on the scene until 20 minutes later. </seg>
<seg id=196> John McNeil, the Police Complaints Commissioner, has demanded that both forces apologize to the parties concerned and has ordered investigations into the events. </seg>
<seg id=197> The Labour Party justice spokesman has criticized Scottish Justice Minister Kenny MacAskill for failure to properly conduct public security matters. </seg>

<seg id=199> "If somebody dials the 999 police emergency number, according to regulations, there's definitely an extremely urgent incident occurring. That's without question." </seg>
<seg id=200> A spokesman for the Lothian and Borders district police force said five police officers that had handled Mr. Guo's mishap had been given "corrective advice". </seg>

<seg id=401> [Original Debate Topic] Kindergarden with a Sky-high Price Tag </seg>
<seg id=402> Kindergarden with a Sky-high Price Tag </seg>
<seg id=403> < Click to copy the address of this post and recommend it to friends > </seg>
<seg id=404> Located near the Nanhu Lake Amusement Park, the Nanhu Art Kindergarden's beautiful scenery in the surrounding area and the high-end facilities in the kindergarden attracts a lot of parents and their children for a visit. The parking lot is packed with all kinds of high-end cars: BMS, Mercedes, Land Rover are not few in number. </seg>
<seg id=405> But the annual tuition of 60,000 yuan is too much to bear. One year's tuition for the kindergarden is the equivalent of 10 years at a university. </seg>
<seg id=406> However, what's so special about this kindergarden? </seg>
<seg id=407> 1. Kang Zheng, the general manager of the kindergarten and the Executive Chairman of Guangzhou International Economics College, explains that the kindergarten features foreign languages and arts and it conducts "elite education." </seg>
<seg id=408> Ye Xiaoju, the chief of the kindergarden, explains that the head of this kindergarten is an American and that 70% of the teachers are foreigners from the USA, the UK, the United Emirates and other counties. </seg>
<seg id=409> The nannies here, including the maids who do the laundry, cook meals and mop the floors, are all Filipino maids who can speak foreign languages. </seg>
<seg id=410> Every month, there will be a week to promote culture of different countries. </seg>
<seg id=411> "We'll make sure that our children not to lose their Chinese culture while getting connected to foreign cultures." </seg>
<seg id=412> Students studying here are guaranteed to study at an elementary school in Singapore, accompanied by their parents. </seg>
<seg id=413> The kindergarten is located in a two-story building among the American Story villas and with a total area of around 2,000 square meters. </seg>
<seg id=414> Seventy percent of the teachers are foreigners, and cooks and cleaning crew are all foreigners. </seg>
<seg id=415> 2. By the time of graduation, the children must be able to achieve the six "threes:" upon graduation, the children are able to carry on a 30-minute conversation with a foreigner whom they don't know, they should be able to play three musical pieces, make three pieces of pottery, dance three dances, sing three songs and paint three paintings. </seg>
<seg id=416> 3. The children will have 80 piano lessons, 40 painting and dance lessons, and in addition 20 pottery lessons. </seg>
<seg id=417> The kindergarten is managed by two kindergarten managers of Chinese and foreign nationality. Three teachers are allocated to each class in addition to the training from six European and American teachers, thus the little kids can receive a “biliterate and trilingual” cultural influence. </seg>
<seg id=418> In terms of everyday life, they follow the daily menu designed by nutrition experts. One nanny keeps a record 24 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id=419> 4. The kindergarten is more like a children's amusement park with a Disney fairytale castle design and colorful play facilities all around. </seg>
<seg id=420> In addition to a large outdoor toys area, the kindergarten also has various function areas such as the little farmhouse, a library, a piano room and also a pottery studio and a dance studio. There's even a rock climbing area, a golf course and a heated swimming pool. </seg>
<seg id=421> Such "luxury facilities" make many visiting parents gasp in amazement. </seg>
<seg id=422> Parents can also track their child's school life through dozens of video cameras installed in the campus. </seg>
<seg id=423> The interior decoration and furnishing exhibit luxury everywhere you turn to.  The beds are 1,800 yuan each and the furniture is all famous brands. </seg>
<seg id=424> The kindergarden installed fingerprint identification system. You can pick up the kids only if your fingerprints match the one on file. </seg>
<seg id=425> Letting a small number of people become nobles first might not be wrong. But, I hope people in the rural areas can have their own kindergarden - kids too small are not suitable for taking public transportation back and forth. </seg>
<seg id=426> Our new rural construction, why can't we afford to build new kindergartens? And they have to go to the cities, and they are forced to accompany their children in their studies and buy houses. Whom is our education system destroying? </seg>
<seg id=427> [Social Phenomenon] On True Happy Marriage </seg>
<seg id=428> On True Happy Marriage < Click to copy the address of this post and recommend it to friends > </seg>
<seg id=429> Everybody wants to be happy. </seg>
<seg id=430> To most people, whether one's marriage is happy or not is of great importance. </seg>
<seg id=431> But a true happy marriage doesn't build upon superficial things. </seg>
<seg id=432> Since the birth China's modern romance movies and TV dramas, girls are becoming spoiled princess, and girls are portrayed as gold diggers. </seg>
<seg id=433> To attract ratings by this approach,  or should we say these directors follow trends and only know how to copy each other's subjects and styles? </seg>
<seg id=434> Anyway, under the influence of this kind of movies and television dramas, too many Chinese girls' personalities have been influenced and twisted without them knowing. </seg>
<seg id=435> Many girls feel that bashing or cursing their boyfriend or husband at will is the norm. </seg>
<seg id=436> They think their husband should serve them unconditionally. Men should be willing to spend money on women, and only that can show he loves you. And a wrong value system has been formed. </seg>
<seg id=437> I have to admit, today some men are also influenced by this trend and have become women's slaves. </seg>
<seg id=438> But most men abandoned their girlfriend or wife because they cannot stand the suffering any more. </seg>
<seg id=439> This is also the main reason for China's skyrocketing divorce rate. </seg>
<seg id=440> Many couples who would have been a good match break up because of this. </seg>
<seg id=441> Many would-be loving couples divorced because of this. </seg>
<seg id=442> This is very tragic. </seg>
<seg id=443> But now many girls still naively believe that to love them only means to forgive their own mistakes unconditionally and to tolerate their own willful indulgence. This kind of women are destined for tragedy. </seg>
<seg id=444> You have to know that true happiness and true pleasure cannot be built upon other people's suffering. </seg>
<seg id=445> People are born equal. No one has the right to bully others. </seg>
<seg id=446> Even people with great personalities cannot unconditionally accept other people's bullying. </seg>
<seg id=447> The essence of human emotions is like a spring, the more your push it, the more it will fight back. </seg>
<seg id=448> Do to no one what you yourself dislike. </seg>
<seg id=449> The one that truly loves you will tell you your shortcomings and mistakes in candid. </seg>
<seg id=450> If he sees you mistakes and choose to ignore, then he doesn't really love you. </seg>
<seg id=451> He is just cheating on you, and playing you. If a girl only thinks everyday of finding a man who cajoles her all day long, then the girl will probably not find the true happiness. </seg>
<seg id=452> Material desires has flooded today's society, most people are only looking for short-lived enjoyment and satisfaction. Be they men or women, frequent lowly behavior has become the routine. </seg>
<seg id=453> Many men treat girls only as sex objects and reproduction tools. They think that winning over girls relies on being able to coax them in and getting what they want is the real aim.  And precisely this kind of thinking has made too many girls gradually lose trust in love. </seg>
<seg id=454> They view many unrealistic things as real things, for example, being material life and being able to coax girls in. </seg>
<seg id=455> Marx once said that marriage without love is a disguised form of prostitution. </seg>
<seg id=456> But most of today's marriages in China are based on materialistic conditions. </seg>
<seg id=457> This is why too many old men have become hot merchandise. </seg>
<seg id=458> Because old men have the materialistic conditions, and old men know how to coax girls in. </seg>
<seg id=459> People have gradually lost the correct definition of love.  True love is not built on deceiving. True love is not because you're pretty, it's not because you have a nice figure. </seg>
<seg id=460> True love is built upon mutual attraction, mutual respect, mutual support, and caring for each other. </seg>
<seg id=461> And a truly harmonious and satisfactory marriage is built upon mutual sacrifice of both man and woman. </seg>
<seg id=462> Whether it's the man taking charge of external affairs and the woman taking charge of internal affairs, or the man and the woman share the necessities for living, they can be together forever only if there is harmony.  One can have a happy life only if he has true love. </seg>
<seg id=463> VOA Plans to Stop Chinese Radio Broadcast and TV Programs </seg>
<seg id=464> VOA Plans to Stop Chinese Radio Broadcast and TV Programs </seg>
<seg id=465> Report from the Deutsche Welle website, February 15 </seg>
<seg id=466> Original title: VOA to Cease Chinese Radio Broadcast and TV Programs </seg>
<seg id=467> VOA plans to cancel its Mandarin and Cantonese radio broadcast and TV programs, retaining only its Chinese website, and will lay off our large number of employees. </seg>
<seg id=468> The American Broadcasting Board of Governors submitted its budget for the 2012 fiscal year to Congress, including the above plan for financial cuts, on February 14. </seg>
<seg id=469> This budget stated that starting from October 1st this year, VOA plans to stop all its Chinese shortwave, medium wave and satellite TV programs and to completely cancel its Cantonese broadcasts.  In addition, it plans to lay off 45 people, 38 of them will be from the Mandarin department. </seg>
<seg id=470> Currently, VOA's Mandarin department has a total of 69 employees. </seg>
<seg id=471> The American Broadcasting Board of Governors submitted the budget after Obama announced the US Government's budget for fiscal year 2012. </seg>
<seg id=472> VOA is one of the government organizations under the supervision of the American Broadcasting Board of Governors. Established in 1942, it is one of the most renowned Chinese broadcasting agencies in the world. </seg>
<seg id=473> This decision will mean the end of an era. </seg>
<seg id=474> Taking Public Transport and Bicycles should Become One of the Assessment Criteria of Leaders </seg>
<seg id=475> Government cars have become a social problem in China. </seg>
<seg id=476> Government cars not only cause congestions, some government car riders flaunt their power and are hated by the people, and it's causing social instability. </seg>
<seg id=477> In fact, in most cases government cars aren't necessary. Leading cadres should set a good example by bicycling or take the public transport to work. </seg>
<seg id=478> In addition, we should make it an assessment criteria of leaders wether or not he bikes or takes public transport to work. </seg>
<seg id=479> In western developed countries, local government officials taking public transport or bicycling to work are quite common. </seg>
<seg id=480> For example, former governor of Massachusetts and Democratic Party presidential candidate Dukakis takes the Boston subway to work. </seg>
<seg id=481> Former New York Mayor Bloomberg also took public transport. </seg>
<seg id=482> Today, to resolve congestion in London, the mayor leads the way in biking to work. </seg>
<seg id=483> Why can't our leading cadres do it? </seg>
<seg id=484> Beijing has 700,000 government cars. </seg>
<seg id=485> If on average one car per cadre, then it's 700,000 cadres, more than the population in Boston. </seg>
<seg id=486> Too many officials! </seg>
<seg id=487> So many cadres all use government cars. They are not only out of touch with real life, unaware of the hardships of the people, but have also caused serious congestion in the city. </seg>
<seg id=488> Government cars are a way of separating cadres from the people and it should be abolished in principal. </seg>
<seg id=489> Think about it, what would happen if we set whether or not they take public transportation or bike to work as a assessment criteria of the cadres? </seg>
<seg id=490> One can say this is a fantastic way to create a harmonious society and to correct the one-sided pursuit of GDP growth. </seg>
<seg id=491> If there are so many complaints and public anger in the area that they govern, then the cadre won't dare to take the bus or bike on the street. </seg>
<seg id=492> The reason that the London mayor can bike on the streets by himself in an ostentatious manner is that the city he governs has basic policing and the common people live and work in peace and will not stop him on his way. </seg>
<seg id=493> If a leading cadre does not dare to appear on the streets or take the public transport in the area he governs, what qualifications does he have to be an official in this place? </seg>
<seg id=494> Historically, places where government officials dared to walk freely on the streets were always places with good governance and also more modern places. </seg>
<seg id=495> For example, the autonomous cities or city states in middle age Europe were the birthplace of capitalism, and their economies and cultures were the most advanced. </seg>
<seg id=496> From Florence, Venice and Bruges to Amsterdam, at least in the golden age, the officials who governed the cities normally interacted with the citizens on the streets, just like fish and water. </seg>
<seg id=497> And this might be the major reason for the citizens' trust in their government. </seg>
<seg id=498> We all know that officials who constantly do things in a perverse way won't survive in this kind of environment. </seg>
<seg id=499> In fact, this fish-and-water relationship also stops officials from doing things in a perverse way. </seg>
<seg id=500> This is a good way to fight corruption. </seg>
<seg id=501> Harmonious society should not remain only as words, the key is do it. </seg>
<seg id=502> How? </seg>
<seg id=503> Leading cadres should take public transport and bike and should form a fish-and-water relationship with the people. </seg>
<seg id=504> One after accomplishing this first stop can you start discussing other issues. </seg>
<seg id=505> If leading cadres cannot even get along with the people on the streets or in their daily lives, then how can we possibly have a harmonious society? </seg>
<seg id=506> Japanese Elderly's Greatest Happiness in New Year </seg>
<seg id=507> Many Chinese travelers who have been to Japan, and many told me: "Japanese elderly are really diligent.  They either drive taxis or  clean hotel rooms or work as security guards for commercial buildings.  They all look really really old, and I don't know if they're up to the job, but in any case they give 100% to their job every day!" </seg>
<seg id=508> Indeed, in Tokyo, you hardly ever see old people walking their birds or practicing singing in early morning in the parks as in Beijing. </seg>
<seg id=509> Also, not to mention that Chinese elderly like to do some Tai-Chi etc. in the early morning.  To old Japanese elderly, this is just luxury! </seg>
<seg id=510> Most of them just shun away from it. </seg>
<seg id=511> Japanese law states that men and women over 75 can still drive, but they need to voluntarily affix a red sticker in the shape of a leaf. </seg>
<seg id=512> To put it nicely, the sticker is called a "red leaf."  Put not so nicely, the sticker is called a "fallen leaf," which is equivalent to saying the old person is about to die, which is completely jinxing it! </seg>
<seg id=513> According to statistics, the number of perpetrators of traffic accidents in Japan last year who were over 75 increased by 150% compared with ten years ago, and less than 35% of the cars has the "red leaf" sticker. So in order to improve traffic management, the National Police Agency of Japan decided that from June 2008 it would enforce the "red leaf" sticker for the old drivers.  Violators would be fined and sued. </seg>
<seg id=514> But who'd have thought that the Japanese elderly were so united.  They were firmly opposed to making the "fallen leaf" sticker an issue. And they thought that this radical move was an outrageous insult to their society which respects elders, and it was absolutely unacceptable! </seg>
<seg id=515> In the end, the National Police Agency of Japan finally changed their minds by Christmas and revoked the rule for the compulsory "red leaf" sticker, and back-peddled to the principle of voluntary affixing of the sticker. </seg>
<seg id=516> One Japanese elderly said: "We're not forced to put the sticker on, great! This is my greatest happiness this year!" </seg>
<seg id=517> After saying this, the elderly floored the gas pedal and the car went roaring away as if it took off! </seg>
<seg id=518> The picture blow shows the "red leaf" stick on elderly's car. </seg>
<seg id=519> In fact, if the news that AV idol Ai Ijima had committed suicide had not been broken on Christmas night that year, the news that elderly drivers no longer needed to affix the "fallen leaf" sticker would have dominated a portion of the Japanese media.  But this would never exceed everyone's curiosity and shock over a beautiful woman's suicide. Eventually, Japanese society isn't interested in whether or not old people are happy. At least they don't seem to be interested. </seg>
<seg id=520> In comparison, Ai Ijima, who was not found until one week after her death, even now, her blog before her death has been so oversubscribed with a flurry of condolences on the comments section. </seg>
<seg id=521> See details at Ai Ijima's blog below. </seg>

<seg id=523> To Show Beautiful Female Members of Performing Troupe of Nepal Maoists (Picture) </seg>
<seg id=524> The Chinese military has performing troupes, for example, there are performing troupes at the Air Force Political Department, Navy Political Department, General Political Department and then locally in each major military region. The Shenyang Military Region has the frontline troupe. The Jinan Military Region has the vanguard. The Nanjing Military Region has the frontline. The Fuzhou Military Region has the Pioneer. The Beijing Military Region has the comrades. The Guangzhou Military Region has the soldiers. The Chengdu Military Region has the battle flags. The Lanzhou Military Region has the combats. </seg>
<seg id=525> It is said that these names were all approved by Chairman Mao, and that's why they are still used till today. </seg>
<seg id=526> The blogger Qin Quanyao lives in Dengshikou in Dongcheng, Beijing. When he was attending middle school at No. 25 Middle School, the school's eastern gate faced directly the performing troupe of the Air Force Political Department. </seg>
<seg id=527> God, the female members of the performing troupe from there were really pretty.  They walked like lotus leaves waving in the wind.  Everyone says it's quite a scene on the street. </seg>
<seg id=528> It's just fantastic! </seg>
<seg id=529> Back then, Mr. Qin once changed the lyrics of a song which sings: The east is red, the sun is rising, China's beautiful girls come from the Air Force Political Department. </seg>
<seg id=530> Wherever there are performing troupes, people can really enjoy." </seg>
<seg id=531> The Nepal Communist Party has a Maoists army, which have also created a Chinese-style performing troupe. </seg>
<seg id=532> Each time the organization holds a summary assembly, a celebration assembly, or an awards ceremony, for the finale, there will be a performance staged by the performing troupe. </seg>
<seg id=533> The contents of the performance are, of course, praises of the organization, praises of the leader, and praises of Prachanda as the Red Sun. </seg>
<seg id=534> Prachanda places great importance to the performances by the performing troupe. He often gives guidance before the performance, and pays a visit on the stage after the performance. </seg>
<seg id=535> A scene like this will surely make members of the performing troupe cry. </seg>
<seg id=536> Just like in China, the female members of the performing troupe are extremely pretty. </seg>
<seg id=537> They are from everywhere in Nepal, and they can perform the most unique songs and dances. Of course there are the Sherpa girls who look similar to Tibetan people. </seg>
<seg id=538> Everything is well organized when the performance is in progress. People who maintain order wear a head figure of Prachanda on their chests. </seg>
<seg id=539> The Migrant Workers who Search for Their Children at Zunyi Railway Station </seg>
<seg id=540> They are migrant workers from counties and cities near Zunyi. Trafficking gangs  abducted their children within one year and till this day they don't know the whereabouts of their children. </seg>
<seg id=541> They are very determined, saying they would do this one thing for their whole life, they are determined to find their children, until they die. </seg>
<seg id=542> I hope that everyone can help pass on the message. I hope the criminals can be caught soon and the separated family members can unite as early as possible. </seg>

<seg id=545> Discussions on "Governance by Meritorious Officials' Descendants" in History from the Example of Zhou Yafu </seg>
<seg id=546> Traditional politics in Chinese history usually have five phases: governance by meritorious officials, governance by meritorious officials' descendants, governance by virtuous officials, governance by treacherous officials, and governance by sycophant officials. </seg>
<seg id=547> Another way to put it, "the influence of men of virtue does not last more than five generations." </seg>
<seg id=548> Among them, governance by meritorious officials' descendants was very obvious at the beginning of Han Dynasty. </seg>
<seg id=549> Zhou Yafu is a typical example among them. </seg>
<seg id=550> When meritorious officials assisted the highest ranking official in winning the world, their descendants were not necessarily involved (with the exception of feudalistic dynasties established by minorities such as the Manchus and Monguls). </seg>
<seg id=551> But, his up-bring followed exactly the trajectory of the meritorious officials assuming power. </seg>
<seg id=552> This gives the meritorious officials' descendants plenty of practice and extraordinary experience. </seg>
<seg id=553> Zhou Bo led the imperial guards in subduing the Zhu Lv, and Zhou Yafu defeated the seven greats by waiting at ease.  Neither of these happened by coincidence. </seg>
<seg id=554> Even the fate of the father and son was not a coincidence, either. </seg>
<seg id=555> For this kind of tradition, the evolution of the governance by meritorious officials into the governance by the descendants of meritorious officials is inevitable historically and politically. Under normal circumstances, nobody can stop it. </seg>
<seg id=556> So, if one remains calm when seeing strange things, the strangeness will do no harm. </seg>
<seg id=557> However, compared with meritorious officials, the descendants of meritorious officials are of a lesser grade after all. </seg>
<seg id=558> This is because the descendants of meritorious officials grew up in different environment from that of the meritorious officials. </seg>
<seg id=559> Although they learned certain strengths of the meritorious officials, some of the strengths or experiences  were too hard for them to match. </seg>
<seg id=560> After all, the descendants of meritorious officials grew up in the riches. Their understanding of hardship was limited to the oral narration or recollection of their ancestors.  They did not know it firsthand. </seg>
<seg id=561> Therefore, the hardship which they often preached often stayed on the level of average performance, and it doesn't amount to any substantive understanding. </seg>
<seg id=562> The Xuanzong Emperor Zhu Zhanji of the Ming dynasty followed his grandfather Zhu Di on several northern expeditions but he didn't even want to touch the food of the common people. </seg>
<seg id=563> (At any rate, his mother had two bites as the Empress Dowager, but Zhu Zhanji wouldn't eat anything). </seg>
<seg id=564> This is the difference. </seg>
<seg id=565> Zhou Bo's imprisonment originated from the Emperor's distrust.  Zhou Bo himself had not left any evidence of arrogance in the hands of other people. </seg>
<seg id=566> But, we have to say that Zhou Yafu was rude when he reached out for chopsticks from Han Jing Emperor. To Zhou Yafu, this is the norm. </seg>
<seg id=567> In fact, this was also the norm of governance by meritorious officials' descendants. </seg>
<seg id=568> Their pride deep inside their bones was on constant display and there is no way to fake it. </seg>
<seg id=569> To be fair, in several time periods the knowledge and abilities of meritorious officials' descendants were quite extraodinary.  Naturally, there were many flaws as well. </seg>
<seg id=570> Then, how to avoid the risk of governance by meritorious officials' descendants? </seg>
<seg id=571> That would be a democratic system, which was wishful thinking in the feudalistic era. </seg>
<seg id=572> The advantage of the democratic system is not that it can prevent problems from happening, but that it prevents big problems from happening the best it can, or that there is still room to recover some of the loss after big problems happened. </seg>
<seg id=573> But that's another topic. </seg>
<seg id=574> Comrade Jiang Qing </seg>

<seg id=579> Review: Why do We the Induction of Luc Montagnier by Shanghai Jiaotong University? </seg>
<seg id=580> The People's Daily's report on Page 12 on November 22 of last year that Luc Montagnier (Luc Montagnier, also translated as Luc Montagnier, see Wikipedia for details), one of the winners of 2008 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, had accepted an invitation from Shanghai Jiaotong University to become the university's chair professor aroused a lot of attention because before this there are few cases of a Chinese university appointing a Nobel Prize winner as full time professors. </seg>
<seg id=581> Picture from media reports after Montagnier received the Nobel Prize </seg>
<seg id=582> However, this seemingly happy news has caused much criticism and even condemnation within the domestic academic and critic circles. The reason being that this Mr. Montagnier, who had made certain contributions to AIDS research in the past, starts to veer off his path in recent years, including his clinical trials of autism therapy (see reports on Nature) whose experimentation methods are allegedly "not mainstream." It's also because his obsession with the so-called molecular homeopathy. These are all highly controversial and unratified issues within the science and research field, and his peers even say it has elements of pseudo-science. </seg>
<seg id=583> Science Magazine (Science) then had an exclusive interview with Montagnier (see repost at "Being Grateful" at Shanghai Jiaotong University), and used an intriguing title: French Nobelist Escapes "Intellectual Terror" to Pursue Radical Ideas in China (French Nobelist Escapes "Intellectual Terror" to Pursue Radical Ideas in China). </seg>
<seg id=584> Obviously, in this not-so-complete interview, Science's editor has raised a number of questions from the perspective of academic standards. Montagnier's responses, however, failed to provide favorable testimony to overturn or answer these questions. It merely left an overly open space for people's "imagination." </seg>
<seg id=585> Because the issues in discussion already reached as deep as the details of experimentations, his Nobel laureate status also cast confusions to Chinese media and the general public. We believe that, in additional to the current voices of questioning, we also need an in-depth "full analysis" in order to put forward substantive views on "what is Montagnier's research about" and "how to view his research." </seg>
<seg id=586> So, a couple of squirrels from the Scientific Squirrels Club first chatted in private and then formed a discussion. Through repeated readings of his three most recent papers, we raised some new questions. On this basis we put our efforts together and completed two articles, "Physics without discussion of details is roguery" and "A biology wonder: DNA from unknown sources," which are "paper reviews" from perspectives of different academic disciplines on Montagnier's experiments and theories. They are being published separately today and tomorrow to help all readers and interested media to analyze the matter. </seg>

<seg id=590> On March 6th, 7th and 8th, 2011, poet, writer, and strategic planner Hai Mo held a super dialogue, which lasted three days and three nights at the Intelli Center in Beijing, with He Xuelin, the renowned strategic planner who is famous for planning Shi Yuzhu's coming back. </seg>
<seg id=591> The dialogue comprehensively reviewed and combed through Mr. He Xuelin's two decades of practice of strategic planning. The two had a very creative and constructive dialogue the status quo, future, opportunities and difficulties of China's strategic planning industry and other cutting-edge topics. </seg>
<seg id=592> The "Hai-He dialogue" is called the "most amazing dialogue in history between strategic planners." The comprehensiveness of the dialogue, the depth of the language in the dialogue and the length of the dialogue all set a record in history. </seg>
<seg id=593> What makes Hao Mo's facial expression so serious and murderous? </seg>
<seg id=594> Hao and Mr. He Xuelin are having in-depth discussions on the status quo and future of China's strategic planning industry. </seg>
<seg id=595> My Barbaric Family Xiaofei Education Mafia-style </seg>
<seg id=596> I told Xiaofei while he was eating: eat well, and when you grow up you won't be afraid of fights and brawls! </seg>
<seg id=597> Yes! </seg>
<seg id=598> He waved his tiny fist at me. </seg>
<seg id=599> I told Xiaofei while he was washing his face: wash yourself clean, and when you grow up you can fool around with girls! </seg>
<seg id=600> He showed his dreamy little eyes to me. </seg>
<seg id=601> Every time when he shares his food with me I'd say: Our people are of one group, and we must share our hardships and food. </seg>
<seg id=602> If there is married women visiting, I'll rush to cover Xiaofei's flattering face. </seg>
<seg id=603> Wait, remember not to get too close to married women... </seg>
<seg id=604> What Boundaries Have Been Crossed? </seg>
<seg id=605> There are more and more group activities in Beijing, but very few has produced any real impact and effect. </seg>
<seg id=606> Most of them gather different kinds of people in a "cross-boundary" style for gossips, which lacks of real content and meaning culture should have. </seg>
<seg id=607> This is a classic "everyone will have their fifteen minutes of fame" era, as put by Andy Warhol. Of course his fame didn't last just 15 minutes. </seg>
<seg id=608> Words should not have the pleasure of making love, because that's not what words are for. </seg>
<seg id=609> Words are the embodiment of human civilization, and they're the symbol of distinction between human and other animals. </seg>
<seg id=610> There are too many people on weibo abusing words. </seg>
<seg id=611> In this age, what boundaries have we crossed exactly? </seg>
<seg id=612> After Watching Movie "I Am Number Four": Will There Be a Sequel? </seg>
<seg id=613> When I watched movies when I was a child, I was always thinking how the movie should continue after it's ended, and my imagination just flew. Later on, I slowly realized that all these were merely mirages, designed by the authors, screenwriters and directors. </seg>
<seg id=614> In "I Am Number Four," we see aliens come to earth without a reason. No reason for why they needed to protect earth, just a lot of chasing and killing, like the love, hate and resentment in China's martial art arena... </seg>
<seg id=615> In "I Am Number Four," from the killing of Number 3 in wilderness, to the internet, to the legend of space in another planet, to the hi-tech weapons, to the fight on American campus, to the forgery of identity documents, it has it all... </seg>
<seg id=616> Pursuit and killing of Number 4 has become the theme of the entire movie. It's similar to Harry Potter seven, "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows," where protecting Harry Potter was the theme... </seg>
<seg id=617> There are many guardians protecting Number Four in "I Am Number Four." This is also like a legend. Anyway, in "I Am Number Four," we realize the existence of a mission system, which is more like a fight between super games... </seg>
<seg id=618> You can watch "I Am Number Four" during the weekend, it will help you pass the weekend. Although it's not as fun as blockbuster movies, but these fights already look like the fights in Chinese martial arts movies. If we say Chinese movies focus on martial arts and Kung Fu, the American movies focus more on the integration of high-tech... </seg>
<seg id=619> "I Am Number Four" didn't give us an ending, just like Harry Potter 7, there will be a sequel… </seg>
<seg id=620> Time to Place Big Bet on Mobile Internet Gaming </seg>
<seg id=621> Article by Zhang Shule Shanda Games CEO Tan Qunzhao said Shanda plans to push mobile internet platform in addition to its PC platform. </seg>
<seg id=622> But up until now, almost every first-tier internet gaming company has mentioned similar ideas but no results to be seen. As long as existing pie, i.e. internet gaming, is still easy to make a profit, no gaming company wants to place big bets on mobile internet games. </seg>
<seg id=623> Overall, internet gaming's advance into mobile internet is a very good opportunity, but for now it remains only at conceptual level. </seg>
<seg id=624> In fact, the idea of expanding online gaming to mobile Internet has been around for more than one or two years.  But the key reason for no growth points have been formed yet is that an appropriate integration point has yet been found: Online games have not yet been really embedded into mobile phones because of restrictions from many factors such as mobile phone model, Internet speed etc. </seg>
<seg id=625> But now the industry has not formed an opinion on how to develop this blue ocean. </seg>
<seg id=626> In my opinion the integration point would be browser-based games, and browser-based games or the integration of internet games with mobile device would in 2011. Browser-based games would be the one to open up the interface between internet games and mobile internet, because browser-based games can be used on iPad and other devices, and mobile Internet on e-books, laptops, cell phones and other products. </seg>
<seg id=627> In addition, if released to a precise target population, the profitability will be higher too, wether it's completely free and profit from advertisement only, or uses the pay-to-play game model. </seg>
<seg id=628> Plus, online game companies are now half a beat slower, and some video websites has already entered online games through browser-based games. </seg>
<seg id=629> The reason that video websites are entering online game business is that, they hope to find profit-making points through money-burning videos and their huge user base, and to bring their users to online games. Instead of advertise for somebody else, you can produce you own, because the development cost for online games are not high in general. </seg>
<seg id=630> Furthermore, besides video websites, platforms with traffic will all try operating with browser-based games. </seg>
<seg id=631> There are already some rather successful cases today, such as PPS video on demand. It's the right time for video websites to enter the scene. </seg>
<seg id=632> All in all, 2011 is a very hopeful year for online games. </seg>
<seg id=633> The slowdown of the online gaming industry wasn't because users stop playing game, but because online gaming companies start to focus on research and development. Online gaming industry is for sure to rebound. </seg>
<seg id=634> This article is an edited version of my interview with IT Business News Net. Comments are welcome. </seg>
<seg id=635> Are kids today more unfortunate? </seg>
<seg id=636> Yesterday I saw a British report on "high quality childhood," and the conclusion was that today's kids are more unfortunate. </seg>
<seg id=637> The reasons are: 1. today's divorce rate is much higher. 2. More of today's moms go out to work. </seg>
<seg id=638> If these two reason are really so important, then how can our kids live on? How many mothers among us are willing to not work because of their kids? </seg>
<seg id=639> Pushkin Town (Tsarskoye Selo) - French Garden </seg>
<seg id=640> Pushkin Town is a small town 24 km from St. Petersburg in its south suburbs, and it used to be a royal property. </seg>
<seg id=641> In fact, the region covers two parts, Alexander Park and Catherine Park. </seg>
<seg id=642> Today, most tourists visit the park that consists primarily Catherine Palace. </seg>
<seg id=643> Speaking of Catherine Palace, its garden can be divided into two parts based on its style: </seg>
<seg id=644> One part is the French garden surrounding the palace. </seg>
<seg id=645> The other part is a British garden surrounding a lake located in the southwest of the palace. </seg>
<seg id=646> The main characteristic of the French garden is its meticulous layout - neat, orderly, and in general symmetrical, including the front lawn of the palace, ponds, roads, sculpture and decoration, etc. </seg>
<seg id=647> The vegetation in the garden is all carefully selected and planted according to artificially created designs. The flowers and trees are trimmed very neatly, with smooth horizontal and vertical lines and with clear edges and corners, as if all items in the garden are lined up to pay attention to their owner, bowing to their master. </seg>
<seg id=648> The exquisite iron work on the gate outside of Catherine Palace     View of the garden from the window of the Catherine Palace  Completely symmetrical layout  Graceful flutist playing in the garden almost all year round  Melodious sound of the flute floats in the air of the elegant garden </seg>
<seg id=649> Cameron Colonnade Cameron Colonnade — a colonnade used for strolling and viewing scenery. It's an ancient Greek and Roman building with a meticulous artistic style and also a classic example of European classicism architecture. </seg>
<seg id=650> Its construction started in 1779, and it was named after its architect Cameron. </seg>
<seg id=651> Architect Charles Cameron from Scotland. </seg>
<seg id=652> His works were deeply beloved by the queen for their simple designs, well balanced forms, their prudent and harmonious colors, and their sofisticated and elegant decorations. </seg>
<seg id=653> On the gentle slopes of Tsarskoye Selo, the Cameron Colonnade was built in accordance with the landscape. The entire building is grandiose, airy and bright. On both sides of the spiraling staircase at the front are decorated with large bronze replicas of statues of Flora (the flower goddess) of ancient Greece and Rome and Hercules (a god of strength), beautiful and elegant. </seg>
<seg id=654> There is boutiques near the pond where one can rent a traditional costume for a photo-shoot. Wearing a traditional costume, it brings you back to the 18th century. The banks of the clear ponds are dotted with statues, the air is filled with classicism. </seg>
<seg id=655> Straight linden trees line up on both sides of the symmetrical and neat garden path. They are everywhere in Russia. Their wood is light and soft, and it's the material for making Russian dolls and other crafts. </seg>
<seg id=656> The vegetations in the garden are commingled together neatly and orderly. Lilac flowers are in full bloom. The same trees can reach higher in Russia! </seg>
<seg id=657> "UK" Employee Who Stole 845 Pounds Frogmarched through Streets; Boss Pays 13,000 Pounds in Compensation </seg>
<seg id=658> In the picture above, the man who was wearing a sign and was frogmarched through street was a British man called Mark Gilbert, the one who was holding his arms was his former boss Simon Cremer. </seg>
<seg id=659> In October, 2008, after finding his employee had written out a company check to himself, cashed it and pocketed it, the angry boss tied his employee up, hung a sign saying "thief - I stole 845 pounds and I'm on my way to the police station," and then frogmarched him through the local streets. </seg>
<seg id=660> In the end, the thieving employee admitted his crime to the police and was released immediately after a warning. </seg>
<seg id=661> But the angry boss was accused of illegal detention. After appearing several times in court, he can only settle the case out of court by paying 5,000 pounds in compensation and 8,000 pounds in legal fees. </seg>
<seg id=662> When interviewed by the Daily Telegraph, this boss, who runs a flooring company, was still indignant: "I think it's absolutely disgusting that he was even able to sue me after he had stolen from me. I don't want to give him a penny after what he did. It disgusts me. He is the thief and I have to pay. It makes me so angry." </seg>
<seg id=663> Mark Gilbert the floor installer who was paraded around the streets said that he want to sue him till the very end of it in order to get more compensation for his mental damage. But he didn't have that much money to file an appeal so he had to accept a 5,000-pound out-of-court settlement. </seg>
<seg id=664> According to him, he wrote the company check without permission not because of greed for money but because his boss owed him salaries which he desperately needed for the holiday. So, he was just "helping" his busy boss write the check. </seg>
<seg id=665> After this incident, he has moved out of the small town. </seg>
<seg id=666> "Hong Kong" If you always date in McDonald's, then you should have a "McWedding" </seg>
<seg id=667> Hong Kong people have one more choice for the wedding banquet, that is have "McWedding" at the McDonald's. </seg>
<seg id=668> McDonald's in Hong Kong launched its wedding package in 2011, and recently the first couple chose to have the novelty wedding in the fast food resteraunt. </seg>
<seg id=669> On valentine's day in 2011, the whole restaurant of a McDonald's near Hong Kong's financial district is decked out with pink balloons. A "cake" made of piled-up apple pies were placed in the middle, with a pile of M-shaped crystal memorial rings on the top. </seg>
<seg id=670> Kevin and Ashely had a unique engagement ceremony with the blessings from their family and friends, all holding McDonald's cold drinks and fast food. </seg>
<seg id=671> This is the first newlyweds after MaDonald's in Hong Kong unveiled its wedding package. The MaDonald's Corporation is very confident in this innovative move. It believes this meets the needs of Hong Kong's young people who love to date in MaDonald's and who feel the traditional wedding venues are too expensive. </seg>
<seg id=672> Shirley Chang, the head of McDonald's in Hong Kong, said in an interview: "They dated here (McDonald's), their love grew here, so their chose here for their big day too." </seg>
<seg id=673> The basic price for McDonald's "warm and sweet wedding package" is 9,999 Hong Kong dollars. Besides food from McDonald's, the package which serves about 12 people also includes wedding gift, invitation cards with the print of McDonald's letter M in yellow, and all sorts of decorations in the venue. </seg>
<seg id=674> With a little more money, the newlyweds can also choose to rent balloon wedding dress, balloon corsage, ballon cakes, and giant pink McDonald's as the background. </seg>
<seg id=675> Comparing to average restaurants in Hong Kong, the price is indeed very attractive. But considering it must be very difficult for the elders to accept, it can only be a wedding venue for those lovers who date in McDonald's. It's a bit difficult for it to become a true wedding venue. </seg>
<seg id=676> "U.S." New York Pregnant Women Enjoy Free Parking Privileges Anywhere </seg>
<seg id=677> Pregnant women in New York are so blessed. The New York government is considering a regulation which allows all pregnant women to park anytime anywhere in New York for free. </seg>
<seg id=678> If the bill proposed by congressman David Greenfield's passes, expectant mothers can legally park their car in every corner of New York City, even places with "no parking" signs,  as long as they take a doctor's certification to the Department of Transportation and apply for a sticker. </seg>
<seg id=679> And, wherever it is, they don't need to pay parking fee. </seg>
<seg id=680> This privilege lasts until one month after their due date (to ensure pregnant women who have not given birth after the due date can also benefit). </seg>
<seg id=681> Mr. Greenfield proposed this bill because his own wife ran into many parking difficulties during her two pregnancies. </seg>
<seg id=682> New York is nationally known for its difficulty in parking. A lot of people with few parking spaces, and the parking costs are also extremely high. </seg>
<seg id=683> Although every parking lot has parking spaces for expectant moms, still sometimes it's difficult to find a space. </seg>
<seg id=684> So he thinks the government should pass this measure to make sure every pregnant woman can park anywhere. </seg>
<seg id=685> Similar legislations have already been implemented in Georgia and Oklahoma, but New York has not. </seg>
<seg id=686> There is not an one-sided agreement to this bill among New Yorkers. On the New York Daily News website, many people posted messages to oppose. </seg>
<seg id=687> Some people say this is gender discrimination. Pregnancy is not a handicap, and it should not be treated differently. </seg>
<seg id=688> If you can drive yourself, why do you need special treatment even the disabled cannot receive? </seg>
<seg id=689> Parking space is a extremely precious resource in New York, and it shouldn't be given to pregnant women like this. </seg>
<seg id=690> Other people say that since pregnant women need to be looked after, it would be better if the government pays taxis for pregnant women. </seg>
<seg id=691> Driving is difficult for pregnant women anyway. If you want to solve the parking problem, it's better to give them money to take taxis, plus this way the cab drivers can help them with carrying stuff and etc. </seg>
<seg id=692> As a matter of fact, this reminds me the great debate not long ago in China with regard to whether we should yield our seats to elders (pregnant women) during rush hours. </seg>
<seg id=693> At the time, there were people saying "these elders already retired, why do they compete with the working people," and "don't get pregnant if you cannot afford taxi." </seg>
<seg id=694> America's pregnant women privilege to park for free is actually the same as the Chinese giving up their seats to pregnant women.  Do you all think that we should dole out kind of special treatment? </seg>
<seg id=695> I cried when watching the movie "Don Quixote" </seg>
<seg id=696> It's indeed a bit late to comment now on a movie premiered last October, but it's rare for Chinese movie to appear in movie theaters overseas. Even "Let the Bullets Fly" cannot fly to Singapore, let alone this one. </seg>
<seg id=697> I watched this movie on my flight with the Singapore Airlines to Japan. The movie itself is an awful 3D movie. It seems that the producer was learning to make a 3D movie rather than creating something. </seg>
<seg id=698> In addition, some vulgar plots also took the film farther away from a classic work. </seg>
<seg id=699> However, none of this could diminish the success of the screenplay, less could it conceal the great glory of human nature of Don Quixote, the main character of the movie. </seg>
<seg id=700> Especially, Don's impassioned speech at the end of the movie made me all in tears. </seg>
<seg id=701> After watching this movie, I treat Don Quixote as someone I respect the most. Although he is a fictional figure, his nearly frenzied behavior when he pursues his dreams deeply touched me. </seg>
<seg id=702> Since ancient times, most people pursue similar things. When somebody is a maverick and the pursue his dreams, people would say he is not practical, or even crazy. </seg>
<seg id=703> I believe I cried because I had similar experience. I rarely complain, because the society won't sympathize with losers. I can only keep trying, to prove myself, and not give up on my dreams. Do you know how difficult this is? </seg>
<seg id=704> I've decided a tentative title for my second book as "Around the World in 80 Days," and the tentative subtitle is "Don't buy a house, buy dreams." This is meant to tell everybody what a pleasure it is to pursue one's dreams. </seg>
<seg id=705> Just as Stephen Chow has put it: Without dreams, humans are not better than salted fish. </seg>
<seg id=706> So, what is your dream? What was your childhood dream? </seg>
<seg id=707> And what are you doing now? </seg>
<seg id=708> Adam Sandler's movie "Mr. Deeds" asked the same questions. </seg>
<seg id=709> No wonder I love Chow and Adam's movies the most. </seg>
<seg id=710> Today Guo Tao also raise the question, so what's your answer? </seg>
<seg id=711> At the end of the movie, Sancho actually fights a windmill. This ending is even deeper than the original work. </seg>
<seg id=712> Let's pursue our dreams, although we'll make some mistakes. </seg>

<seg id=714> Check-in Management System for Storage of Materials </seg>
<seg id=715> 1. When purchased goods (including purchased raw materials, spare parts, etc.) arrive, handling personnel from the Supply Department fills in four identical copies of "commodity acceptance form." </seg>
<seg id=716> (After the warehouse manager signed the "commodity acceptance form," one copy should be left on file at the Supply Department, one copy should be forwarded to the Inspection Department, one copy should be forwarded to the Accounting Department by the Material Control Department, and the warehouse keeps one copy as the proof for issuing a "warehouse check-in form"). </seg>
<seg id=717> The warehouse manager signs the "commodity acceptance form" after counting and inspecting the items against the name, specification, quantity, unit price listed on the "commodity acceptance form." </seg>
<seg id=718> The warehouse manager accurately completes "warehouse check-in form" in triplicate according to the inspection results. Delivery personnel needs to verify the goods against the items on the "commodity check-in form" with the warehouse manager, and sign the "commodity check-in form" after confirming no error is present and the goods match the form. </seg>
<seg id=719> The warehouse manager makes entries in the warehouse inventory, given complete "commodity acceptance form (warehouse check-in stub)" and the registration stub of the "warehouse check-in form." One of the remaining copy should be forwarded to the Accounting Department, the other copy to the Supply Department. </seg>
<seg id=720> 2. Checking-in of the finished products produced by the enterprise itself requires the product quality certification issued by the Quality Control Department and should be hand delivered to the warehouse manager by a designated personnel. </seg>
<seg id=721> The warehouse manager completes the "commodity check-in form" in triplicate according to the circumstances of the check-in process. </seg>
<seg id=722> Both parties sign the "commodity check-in form" after checking with each other and there is no errors present. </seg>
<seg id=723> One copy of the signed warehouse check-in form is for the warehouse to keep as the basis for making entries in the physical commodity inventory, one copy is given to the workshop as the basis for the productivity statistics, and one copy is given to the Accounting Department as the accounting basis for cost analysis and finished products. </seg>
<seg id=724> 3. For the purchased goods that need to go straight to the workshop due to production needs, warehouse check-in and check-out procedures should be completed simultaneously to accurately reflect the amount of logistics within the enterprise. </seg>
<seg id=725> 4. For left over materials from the workshop to return to the warehouse, a material receipt form in red letters should be completed in triplicate, and the reasons should be detailed in the remarks column. </seg>
<seg id=726> If materials are being returned at the end of the month, then the procedures for check-out materials for next month should be completed at the same time when the material return procedures are completed. </seg>
<seg id=727> 5. If quantity, quality, specification and type were found not matching during the warehouse goods inspection and check-in procedure, the warehouse manager has the right to refuse to proceed with the check-in procedure, and could report it to the Supply Department, the Production Department or the business executives for resolution, depending on the procedures. </seg>
<seg id=728> This Sector Leads Indexes Fighting for 3000 </seg>
<seg id=729> Yesterday the indexes were down slightly to close lower than the previous day. </seg>
<seg id=730> The total net outflow of capital from Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets was 9.502 billion yuan. Of which the net outflow of capital from institutions was 1.695 billion yuan and the net outflow of capital from individuals was 7.807 billion yuan. </seg>
<seg id=731> After opening low, the indexes moved up slightly, and after 10:15 it had repeated dives, falling below 5- and 10-day moving averages. </seg>
<seg id=732> But after falling below 2897 points, the intersection of 5- and 10-day moving averages, downstream buyers became active. The market started to climb at 14:15 in the afternoon, and ended lower than the previous day with a small decline. </seg>
<seg id=733> Today the ideal trends would be to open high, and set a new record high. </seg>
<seg id=734> If the market closes with average losses, short-term investments will be troublesome. </seg>
<seg id=735> In a nutshell, you have to jump in no matter what when 3000 points will be reached. </seg>
<seg id=736> To the hot points, yesterday saw a quick switch of hot points. In the morning session, biomedical stocks were very active. We discussed this sector several times before in our daily log.  It always appear active in extraordinary events of index fluctuations, including Guangzhou Pharmaceutical's advance to the upper limit for trading halt  and Fengyuan Pharmaceutical's reaching the upper limit for trading halt, as discussed in the daily log near the 10th. </seg>
<seg id=737> Furthermore, in the real estate sector discussed in an article before market opening yesterday, some real estate stocks benefiting from the guaranteed housing policy are going strong. </seg>
<seg id=738> We maintain our opinion from yesterday that for the indexes to reach 3000 points, real estate, finance (banking, securities, insurance) and non-ferrous metal, etc. serve as advance troops，it's a must. </seg>
<seg id=739> How to Operate after the Central Bank raises Interest Rates </seg>
<seg id=740> People's Bank of China decided to raise the benchmark RMB deposit and lending rates of financial institutions from February 9, 2011. </seg>
<seg id=741> The one-year deposit and lending rates of financial institutions are raised by 0.25 percentage points, respectively. </seg>
<seg id=742> We know that interest rates increases are not directly aimed at the stock market, but mainly because of inflation. </seg>
<seg id=743> In fact, the policy has set a clear tone since the first deposit reserve increase this year. Currently, the basic rhythm of the policy is: deposit reserve increase - interest rates increase - more deposit reserve increase… Obviously, this has entered the main upward trend. </seg>
<seg id=744> Therefore, if you say now that raising interest rates is the last bad financial news, you will be laughed at. </seg>
<seg id=745> Today's stock market is becoming more and more complicated. Many earlier rules apparently is not suitable for the current stock market, because many policies which do not directly affect the stock market have increasing influence on the stock market, and the operations of stock index futures will also become more complicated. </seg>
<seg id=746> I believe the trading days since the beginning of 2011 have made everybody fully realized that the operations are not easy. </seg>
<seg id=747> So, when trading, everyone must think actively and should not just believe in some outdated indicators. </seg>
<seg id=748> During the Spring Festival, a continuous rise in U.S. stocks makes many traders to expect good fortunes at the opening. </seg>
<seg id=749> The main force has also taken out half of the bonuses this afternoon. </seg>
<seg id=750> However, the interest rates increase by the Central Bank will prompt a lot of people to sing a famous song on the Internet called "Uneasy." </seg>
<seg id=751> Apparently, now many people will reconsider their operational strategy for tomorrow. </seg>
<seg id=752> The operational strategy for tomorrow is mainly to keep an close eye on trading benchmarks. </seg>
<seg id=753> I set my trading benchmark at 2800 points, which in fact is just over one point higher than 2798.96 points at closing.  But, don't underestimate this little bit of an increase, it will directly affect our next trading strategy. </seg>
<seg id=754> If the broader market opens high and moves up and breaks the trading benchmark, then we can gradually consider locking in some profit and getting hold of the bonus first, and then determine the next trading benchmark based on the point level at closing. </seg>
<seg id=755> If the broader market opens low, I suggest that you keep watch first and do not hurry to buy in.  When the broader market opens low, our trading strategy for the whole day will mainly be reducing the positions.  In particular if the broader market is running below the trading benchmark most of the time, we must be even more cautious. </seg>
<seg id=756> We can consider buying only if the broader market opens low and moves up, become stable or even break through the trading benchmark. </seg>
<seg id=757> The strategy for operating the positions is very complicated and there are also many details. I suggest everyone think about it carefully according to the market details. For tomorrow, the broader market resistance position: 2805, 2835 points.  Defending position: 2765, 2735 points.  Trading benchmark: 2800 points. </seg>
<seg id=758> 3000 Points is the Moment to Wake up </seg>
<seg id=759> In the morning session, the Shanghai Index fluctuated at low levels after opening, showing a slight lack of confidence in reaching 3000 points. </seg>
<seg id=760> After 10am, the broader market's fluctuation became small and have digested the profit-taking stocks. At the moment, the market's operation structure is already in a good shape. Technically, stock indexes were already poised for a rise and the volume also supports the continued rise of the broader market. </seg>
<seg id=761> The corresponding index trend is also very beneficial to multiple parties. </seg>
<seg id=762> Based on historical experiences, as soon as an upward breakthrough is confirmed, there will be a series of medium to large trends. </seg>
<seg id=763> Right now it's in the process of confirmation, and the market will become relatively vulnerable. </seg>
<seg id=764> After forming pattern of a small head with shoulders at the bottom, the upper resistance comes from the downtrend resistance line formed over the past two years, i.e. the line connecting 3478 points and 3186 points, which is also the upper resistance line of the large symmetrical triangle formed in the past two years, which is near 3100 points right now. </seg>
<seg id=765> Looking at the market, following a surge in coal and non-ferrous metals, banking and real estate stocks picked up the baton. Undervalued blue chips rose one after another, increasing the evaluation mean of the stock indexes. </seg>
<seg id=766> Real estate stocks were going strong today as a huge jump in Vanke's net profit injected excitement into the real estate sector. Then the coal sector, which surged yesterday, showed a clear division today.  China Shenhua opened high but declined, and other coal stocks showed a varying degree of decline. In the mean time, some traders sold off and cashed out, which reflects the impatience of investors holding positions in the sector. </seg>
<seg id=767> But after seeing the strength of stock indexes, we should also see some negative factors, for example banking and real estate stocks which are suffering constantly from administrative controls. The certainty of first quarter reports and the uncertainty of the future have led to a rather big disagreement of the market concerning the two sectors, which will also limit their room to climb. </seg>
<seg id=768> Although no new monetary policy came out last weekend, the share of foreign exchange has surged. It is highly likely that the deposit reserve requirement will be increased again this weekend. </seg>
<seg id=769> The media reported today that the price of Shanghai's commodity housing dropped under 20,000 yuan to reach a new 32-week low, and returned to the level of last July. </seg>
<seg id=770> The transaction decline caused by the housing price battle will significantly discount the rebound in the real estate stock evaluation thanks to the handsome first quarter reports. </seg>
<seg id=771> After a streak of surges, we should remain cautious all the time. While holding positions and waiting for them to go up, we should also be prepared to reduce our positions. Once the breakout becomes impossible, we should immediately reduce our positions to avoid systematic risks! </seg>

<seg id=773> Can Today's Broader Market Pull off a Bullish Line? </seg>
<seg id=774> Good noon, everybody. The selling-offs in today's morning session might have scared some investors. But this is in fact fake, as this blog has already analyzed, the broader market won't have a deep decline, rebound will be the trend. </seg>
<seg id=775> Subsequently, the broader market started to rebound, led by a group of media-hyped stocks which received a lot of media attention, such as agriculture, water conservation, and computer stocks. Of course, the real reason driving the broader market rebound is still the defensive effect of the finance and real estate stocks. After all, it is impossible to depend on media-hyped stocks alone for driving the broader market rebound.  The broader market stocks still need to serve as foundation. Facing such circumstances, naturally the individual stock sectors across the board start to rebound, with seventy percent of individual stocks returning to positive territory. </seg>
<seg id=776> After the broader market rallied earlier for five trading days, it's only natural to reshuffle your positions at the upper level of this round of down trends, which is the Shanghai index 30-day moving average. </seg>
<seg id=777> Yesterday, an upper shadow line appeared, and today stocks stopped declining and started to rebound, and recovered some lost ground. According to the K line theory, this indeed is the K line combination of stopping the decline and bottom out. Although I also believ that right now the broader market still needs time for </seg>
<seg id=778> repeated fluctuations before a rebound. But I'm still anticipating signs of short-term stabilization, and the investors should make continued observations. I've said, the broader market won't be so bad, the key is on the individual stocks. </seg>
<seg id=779> Today, the market still shows signs for a broad rebound. Agriculture stocks are again making strong moves, and individual stocks in computer and industrial sectors are starting to go strong. The percentage of declining individual stocks at the opening of the market was also below 4%, which is an obvious feature of a strong market. </seg>
<seg id=780> I suggest the investors continue to watch the trend of biomedical and agricultural stocks, which have seen active rebounds in the past two days, largely due to their anti-inflation effects and the sufficient adjustment earlier. However, their sustainability remains to be seen. </seg>
<seg id=781> Now the situation is that individual stocks are active, while the broader market lays the foundation. The focus of investors' operation should still be on individual stocks, and moreover, these individual stocks should not be traded just because of a bounce caused by overselling. </seg>
<seg id=782> One thing to keep in mind - don't take it for granted that individual stocks that were oversold earlier will have a greater probability and strength of rebound. This completely wishful thinking.  My experience tells me that, China's stock market is simply a main force market. The strong remain strong and the weak remain weak. The quality of a stock does not depend on the trend and the performance on the surface. The key is if there are main forces and whether or not the main forces are willing to pull them up. Of course, this kind of main force will be more willing to pull up individual stocks supported by performance. This is our standard pick stocks. </seg>
<seg id=783> After a rally in the morning, there is a good chance that the broader market's trend in the afternoon will be maintaining fluctuations while going up or going through strong fluctuations. Of course, the possibility that the broader market may have a medium-to-long bullish line today should not be ruled out either and it can be looked forward to!  That's all for the noontime commentary. Good luck to everyone. </seg>
<seg id=784> Low Point before Second Rally to Start from Here </seg>
<seg id=785> Reminder: the author does not have securities investment consulting qualification, and does not engage in related business! </seg>
<seg id=786> Analysis of the broader market and individual stocks in my blogs and live broadcast is only a display of personal research results which is for personal entertainment. Investors should not operate based solely on the author's judgments! </seg>
<seg id=787> The individual stocks mentioned in the blogs and the individual stocks in the tech stocks and funds stocks pools are only for the author to track his own research, they are not individual stock recommendations! </seg>
<seg id=788> Gist in one sentence: Low Point before Second Rally to Start Here  Against the backdrop of post-holiday climbing in overseas stock markets, the bearish trend at opening must have greatly disappointed many investors. Before the holidays, I repeatedly emphasized around 2800 points that if the pressure was not broken through, it was better to be on the conservative side and to hold the funds through the holidays.  Reality has proven my thoughts were correct. </seg>
<seg id=789> Now that adjustment has started, which position will it be adjusted to? </seg>
<seg id=790> In my opinion, for the Shanghai stock market, take a look at around the 10-day moving average first, and for the Shenzhen stock market, take a look at around the 20-day moving average first. Both remaining trading days of this week will primarily be adjustment. Also, following readjustment, the second rally needs an increase in volume so that the volume of the first rally and the volume of the second rally can form a stepwise moving trend. Otherwise, if there is no increase in volume and no volume is formed for a stepwise uptrend, then there will be no need to talk about the second index rally. And furthermore there will be no need to talk about the formation of a breakout regarding the above concentrated moving average resistance. Thus, the volume of the second rally must exceed the volume on January 27, that is, over 110 billion. </seg>
<seg id=791> With regard to sectors, it is necessary to immediately sell and stay away from the high speed rail and water conservation stocks that have recently surge repeatedly. These two major sectors are basically approaching the end of their rallies.  In the mean time, after the adjustment, it is a must to pay attention to any possible formation of new hot sectors.  Only when new hot sectors have formed can subsequent market conditions have a greater momentum for up-beating indexes. It is estimated that the indexes will form a new trough before a rally near the Shanghai stock market 10-day moving average. The low point in the market may materialize on Friday at the fastest or not materialize until next week at the slowest. Just need to be patient and wait.  See the technical analysis below for more. </seg>
<seg id=792> Technical Analysis: Previously, it looked like the main force would have major moves on the platform from 2564 to 2700 points.  The index range from 2661 to 2800 points satisfies this expectation. So for the location of the second dip, look first at the 10-day moving average and then look at the front low of 2661.  Operational strategy: Wait with patience till the dip is in place. </seg>

<seg id=796> Prince Ghost: Live and Die Together in "Not Regrets" </seg>
<seg id=797> I rarely watch TV dramas. Most of the time I read or study stocks. I watch TV dramas only when they're exceptional good. </seg>
<seg id=798> Recently, I watched "Invisible General," and I was extremely touched by the love and the faith in the party's cause in the drama. </seg>
<seg id=799> After that I haven't watched better TV series for a long time. </seg>
<seg id=800> Last week a client left a message for me: Prince, I recommend to you "No Regrets." Because I had a live broadcast to run, I ignored it. </seg>
<seg id=801> Then another client recommend it to me. I thought at that time that this TV drama is really hot. </seg>
<seg id=802> And then, a third client left me a message, saying "Prince, you must watch this movie, it's even better than "Invisible General," it's more touch... </seg>
<seg id=803> Three clients recommended the same movie to me in one week, this has never happened before. </seg>
<seg id=804> Then, I didn't go to the swimming center in the evening, instead I went to a nearby video store to buy this DVD. </seg>
<seg id=805> Usually I just go to the video store and wonder around. I love the horror movies and cartoons the most. </seg>
<seg id=806> I'm an old man approaching my thirties, and I still love to watch cartoons… blog readers will be laughing at me. </seg>
<seg id=807> Cannot help it. Everyone has their own interests, haha. </seg>
<seg id=808> I asked the store owner what movie he can recommend, and he also recommend this movie. I'm speechless... </seg>
<seg id=809> Since so many people recommend that I watch this, so I'll just watch it. </seg>
<seg id=810> As a result, this week I cannot tell day from night after watching the movie. I slept very poorly, and the movie plots filled my head. </seg>
<seg id=811> Ms. Jiu, the main part, is really moving. </seg>
<seg id=812> Women like this can only exist in heaven and rarely appear in the secular world... </seg>
<seg id=813> Especially the ending… I watched until my heart was broken, and tears filled up in my eyes. </seg>
<seg id=814> I was too much engrossed in the drama… The last blog was about "Invisible General," (you'll know if you browse through my previous blogs) and I also noted my feelings. </seg>
<seg id=815> But for this movie, there is so many afterthoughts and I don't know where to start. I ended up not writing anything. </seg>
<seg id=816> If you want to know what's friendship between friends, what is a family, and what is true and lasting love, then watch this movie. </seg>

<seg id=1> Flocks of Dead Birds Fill Swedish Streets </seg>
<seg id=2> During the last week, a great number of birds died from unknown reasons in the US. Today, Swedish officials said that as many as 100 birds fell on a snow-packed street in Sweden. </seg>
<seg id=3> When commenting on these 50-100 jackdaws, Christer Olofsson (Christer Olofsson), a rescue organization worker from the town of Falkoeping (Falkoeping) in southwestern Sweden, said: "Most of them are already dead." This bird belongs to the raven family. </seg>

<seg id=5> He told the Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet (Aftonbladet): "This is unusual." The tabloid's website published a photo taken by readers. In the photo, flocks of black birds filled a street covered with snow. </seg>
<seg id=6> Wirdheim stated: "They are perhaps jackdaws. They winter in flocks, and if disturbed, may fly until they die due to trauma." </seg>
<seg id=7> Olofsson told AFP, police patrols were the first to find these birds around midnight, and they caught 5 for observation. </seg>
<seg id=8> Olov Andersson (Olov Andersson) from the National Veterinary Institute (National VeterinaryInstitute) told the Swedish news agency TT that they will analyze the bodies of the birds and examine if there are any bacterial or viral infections present, including new strains of the flu. </seg>

<seg id=16> Princess Diana's Wedding Cake Sold 30 Years Later </seg>
<seg id=17> A slice of dried-up cake said to be from the wedding ceremony of Prince Charles (Prince Charles) and Princess Diana (PrincessDiana) 30 years ago was sold on an auction website in New Zealand for 380 New Zealand dollars (290 US dollars). </seg>

<seg id=26> Global Unemployment Reaches Record High, 200 Million Jobless </seg>
<seg id=27> The International Labour Organization (The International Labour Organization) warned today that global economic recovery has yet to be mirrored in job opportunities, with global unemployed remaining at the record high of 205 million in 2010. </seg>
<seg id=28> The International Labour Organization said: "Although some countries have seen significant recovery in economic growth, the official data for global unemployed in 2010 remains at 205 million, almost the same level as in 2009, and 27.6 million more than in 2007 just before the global economic crisis." </seg>
<seg id=29> "The International Labour Organization estimates that for 2011, the global unemployment rate will be 6.1%, which is the equivalent of 203.3 million unemployed." </seg>
<seg id=30> According to the International Labour Organization, since 2007, it is estimates that more than half of the unemployed live in industrialized economies and the EU. Many young people reaching employment age still haven't found jobs." </seg>
<seg id=31> The International Labour Organization found that in developing countries like Brazil, Kazakhstan (Kazakhstan) and Thailand, the unemployment rate has fallen to pre-economic crisis levels. </seg>
<seg id=32> Aside from unemployment, about 1.53 billion people are troubled by a state of "precarious employment", such as doing temp jobs. </seg>
<seg id=33> In addition, unemployment for young people is also dismal. In 2010, the number of unemployed youth people reached 78 million, more than the 73.5 million in 2007 before the economic crisis. </seg>

<seg id=56> British Journalist Expelled for Reporting Russia Having Become a Mafia State </seg>
<seg id=57> The British newspaper The Guardian (Guardian) reported on 7th that Russian security authorities explicitly forbids Guardian's Moscow correspondent from entering Russia. </seg>
<seg id=58> The Guardian stated that Harding (Luke Harding) was expelled because he reported that leaked U.S. diplomatic cables described Russia as a "mafia state" (mafia state). </seg>
<seg id=59> Security sources told the state news service Ria Novosti (RIANovosti) that Harding's name was put on the persona non grata list, and that "as required by one of Russia's security organs, Harding was not allowed to enter the Russian territory." </seg>
<seg id=60> The sources did not reveal any further details, but their comments suggest that the requirement possibly comes from the Foreign Intelligence Service (Foreign IntelligenceService, SVR) or Federal Security Service (Federal SecurityService, FSB). </seg>
<seg id=61> The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia has not given any explanation for expelling the journalist while The Guardian claimed that it believes this is the first case of any British journalist being expelled from Russia since the end of the Cold War. </seg>
<seg id=62> Harding spent two months in London covering the US diplomatic cables exposed by WikiLeaks. He flew back to Moscow last weekend. </seg>
<seg id=63> As reported by The Guardian, he was preparing to enter the country but was denied entry after his passport was checked. After being detained for 45 minutes in a small room of the airport, he was escorted to an airliner and repatriated to Britain. </seg>

<seg id=65> X Rays Explain Fading Colors in Van Gogh's Paintings </seg>
<seg id=66> According to a report published today in the US, scientists from various countries discovered that chemical reactions caused the vivid yellow paintings of Van Gogh to turn to brown. </seg>
<seg id=67> According to a study published by the journal Analytical Chemistry (Analytical Chemistry), scientists used a super-sensitive microscopic X ray and observed that bright lacquer and paint will undergo chemical reactions if exposed to sunlight, causing yellow paint to fade. </seg>
<seg id=68> Ella Hendriks from Van Gogh Museum Amsterdam (Van Gogh MuseumAmsterdam) says: "This kind of advanced research helps us further our understanding of how paintings fade and age, and (the research results) should be conserved for future generations." </seg>
<seg id=69> X ray research conducted by European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (European Synchrotron Radiation Facility) in Grenoble, France also revealed that a reduction in chromium "was especially prominent in the presence of chemical compounds which contained barium and sulphur." </seg>
<seg id=70> The research holds that this observation makes scientists believe "Van Gogh's painting technique of blending white and yellow paints might be the cause of the darkening of the yellow paint in his paintings." </seg>
<seg id=71> The authors of the research paper point out that the best way to prevent works of art from deteriorating is to avoid exposure to ultraviolet rays and sunlight. </seg>

<seg id=74> The snow leopard, hare and polar bear have been selected as the mascots for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games (Winter Olympic Games) to be held in resort city of Sochi in the south of Russia’s Black Sea (Black Sea) coast. </seg>
<seg id=75> These three mascots were chosen by popular vote. Russian State Television’s Channel One (Channel One) announced the election of the snow leopard, hare and polar bear as the mascots from the nine entries that were shortlisted. </seg>
<seg id=76> The snow leopard won the most votes, getting 28% of the total, but Dmitry Chernyshenko (DmitryChernyshenko), Chairman of the Organizing Committee for the 2014 Winter Olympic Games, announced the decision to select three animals as official mascots. </seg>
<seg id=77> Meanwhile, Sun Beam Boy (Sun beam boy) and Snowflake Girl (Snowflake girl) were selected as the mascots for the 2014 Paralympic Games (Paralympic Games). </seg>
<seg id=78> Russian Prime Minister Putin (Vladimir Putin) had previously stated that he wanted the funky snow leopard to represent Sochi. </seg>
<seg id=79> During his tenure as Russian president, Putin was instrumental in Russia's winning of the bid to host the Winter Olympics. He is still the de facto leader of Russia.

<seg id=81> Experts: Cooling Crucial for Preventing Radiation Leak </seg>
<seg id=82> The Science Daily website (ScienceDaily) reported today that US radiation experts say cooling is the key to avoiding disaster from the Japanese nuclear plant crippled by earthquake. </seg>
<seg id=83> After the cooling system malfunctioned, explosions occurred today at Fukushima No. 1 (Fukushima No.1) Nuclear Power Plant 250 kilometers northeast of Tokyo, stoking fear of nuclear reactor core meltdown and radiation leaks. </seg>
<seg id=84> Ron Chesser, director of Texas Tech University (Texas Tech University) Center of Environmental Radiation Studies (Center of Environmental RadiationStudies), was the first US scientist allowed inside the exclusion zone following the Chernobyl (Chernobyl) nuclear disaster in 1992. </seg>
<seg id=85> Chesser told the Science Daily website: "If Japan is having trouble with cooling the reactors, it will trigger an emergency." </seg>
<seg id=86> Chesser pointed out that, although it's reported that the plant reactors have been shut down completely, reactors must be continuously cooled to avoid core meltdown. </seg>
<seg id=87> He said: "There are several specific triggers for declaring a nuclear reactor emergency: one of them is decreased cooling capacity, and another is radiation leakage." </seg>
<seg id=88> Chesser said: "Reactors are not like cars that you can turn off and walk away from. They will continue to produce a lot of heat until the core melts down. Without cooling water, there is a real chance that the core will melt down, which could result in a large amount of radiation leakage." </seg>

<seg id=187> As reported by UK Chinese Times, a recent survey amongst residents revealed that the two police precincts in Scotland both failed to arrive in time after receiving 999 emergency calls. </seg>
<seg id=188> In one case, the Chinese restaurant Hong Kong Express (at Sighthill) in Edinburgh endured racial attacks by street gangs. </seg>
<seg id=189> In front of the restaurant, 20 youngsters with baseball bats, golf clubs and snooker sticks in hand made provocations, shouted racist slurs, and threw bottles at the restaurant. </seg>
<seg id=190> Shopkeeper Guo Jing (Jing Gu, transliteration), his wife, and two other employees were trapped inside the restaurant. </seg>
<seg id=191> Guo dialed 999 ten times, but Lothian and Borders Police arrived at the scene 1.5 hours later. </seg>
<seg id=192> During this period the telephone operator told Guo "the police are coming," but the police didn't come at all. </seg>
<seg id=193> When Mr. Guo called the police for the 10th time, the other side went so far as saying: "I am very clear about your predicament, don't call again." </seg>

Among the 713 cases, 63 were handled under the supervision of the Ministry of Public Security and the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau. They destroyed 220 cigarette counterfeiting dens, seized 446,000 cartons of counterfeit cigarettes and over 18 thousand tons of tobacco leaf and 841 cigarette making machines. This dealt a heavy blow to the crimes of manufacturing and selling counterfeit cigarettes. </seg>
<seg id=398> The Ministry of Public Security and the State Tobacco Monopoly Administration announced the following top ten cases related to crimes of manufacturing and selling counterfeit cigarettes in 2010. </seg>
<seg id=399> The top ten cases are: a suspect surnamed Chen and his accomplices in Xuzhou City, Jiangsu, trafficking counterfeit cigarettes by air; a website named “Jing Hua Yan Yun” in Jilin Province that sold counterfeit cigarettes; a suspect surnamed Chen and his accomplices in Taian, Shandong, trafficking counterfeit cigarettes by railway; the “November 23” case of manufacturing and selling counterfeit cigarette labels in Wuzhou, Guangxi; the transnational manufacture and sale of counterfeit cigarettes in Yiwu, Zhejiang; the Fujian, Xiamen, major case of transnational manufacturing and selling counterfeit cigarettes by a suspect surnamed Chen and his accomplices; the “May 5” super case of manufacturing and selling counterfeit cigarettes in Beijing and Hebei; the “September 10” case of a counterfeit cigarette distribution network in Fuling, Chongqing; the “Tsunami II” campaign in Guangdong; and the “November 27” special campaign in Pingdingshan, Henan. </seg>

<seg id=401> [Original Topic of Debate] Exorbitantly-priced Kindergarten </seg>
<seg id=402> Exorbitantly-priced Kindergarten </seg>
<seg id=403> < Click to copy this web address, or to recommend it to a friend > </seg>
<seg id=404> The South Lake Art Kindergarten is located next to the Nanhu Amusement Park. Attracted by beautiful landscape and the best facilities in the park, a lot of parents brought their children here to have a look. The parking area was filled with all kinds of cars, and there were more than just a few BMWs, Benzes, and Land Rovers. </seg>
<seg id=405> However, the annual tuition of 60,000 Yuan is more than most people can afford. One year of tuition for the kindergarten is equivalent to 10 years of tuition at university. </seg>
<seg id=406> But, what makes the kindergarten special? </seg>
<seg id=407> First, Kang Zheng, executive director of the kindergarten and Executive Chairman of the Guangzhou Foreign Economic Technical College, informed us that the kindergartens focus on "elitist education" in foreign languages and arts are what set is apart. </seg>
<seg id=408> The general director of the kindergarten, Ye Xiaoju, said the principle of the kindergarten is an American and 70% of the teachers are foreigners from the US, UK, UAE, and other countries. </seg>
<seg id=409> All the caregivers here can speak a foreign language, even the maid that does the laundry, cooks, and mops the floor is a Filipino. </seg>
<seg id=410> Each month, we will hold a Culture Week for a different country. </seg>
<seg id=411> "We will allow the kids to learn foreign cultures without losing their identity with the Chinese culture." </seg>
<seg id=412> We guarantee that any child that studies here can get into a primary school in Singapore and the parents can also go there with the child. </seg>
<seg id=413> The Kindergarten is in a two-story building seated inside the Meizhou Gushi Villas. The total use area is about two thousand square meters. </seg>
<seg id=414> 70% of the teachers are foreigners, even the people doing the cooking and mopping the floors are foreigners. </seg>
<seg id=415> Secondly, when the children graduate, they are required to do the "six-threes": The children that graduate are expected to speak English with a foreigner unfamiliar to them for 30 minutes, play three songs, make three pieces of pottery, dance three dances, sing three songs, and draw three pictures. </seg>
<seg id=416> Thirdly, every year, each child has 80 piano lessons, 40 drawing and dance lessons, and, in addition, there are 20 pottery class sessions. </seg>
<seg id=417> Two foreign directors are in charge of the kindergarten. Each class has three teachers, plus six European and American teachers. Thus, each kid receives "bi-cultural and trilingual" education. </seg>
<seg id=418> In life, the daily menu is designed according to nutrition experts. A caregiver keeps track of the records for each twenty-four-hour period. </seg>
<seg id=419> Fourthly, the kindergarten is more like a paradise for children. It is decorated to resemble a Disney-like fairy tale castle, with colorful recreational facilities found all around the premises. </seg>
<seg id=420> In the kindergarten, in addition to the large outdoor toys area, there are all kinds of functional areas, such as the mini farm, library, piano room, pottery art room, dance hall and so on, and there are even an area for rock climbing, a golf court and a swimming pool of constant temperature, </seg>
<seg id=421> Such "luxurious facilities” put many of the parents that were present into a frenzy. </seg>
<seg id=422> Parents can also see how the children are doing in their school life through the dozens of video cameras installed on the campus. </seg>
<seg id=423> Everything inside kindergarten in luxurious, a bed alone costs 1,800 Yuan and all the furniture is name-brand. </seg>
<seg id=424> The kindergarten has installed a fingerprint authentication system. Only after you imprint your fingerprint and the system is able to match it to one stored in the system can you pick up a child. </seg>
<seg id=425> Maybe it’s not a bad idea to let a few people enjoy an upper-class lifestyle first, but I hope commoners in the rural areas can have their own kindergartens. The children are too young to go back and forth by bus. </seg>
<seg id=426> In our new rural construction, why is it that we cannot even cannot afford to build kindergartens? People must move to the city, the commoners are really forced to move to the city and buy houses there so they can go be with their children while they go to school. Who is really being wrecked by our education? </seg>
<seg id=427> [Various Pictures of the Society] On Really Happy Marriages </seg>
<seg id=428> On Really Happy Marriages < < click to copy this web address, or to recommend it to a friend > </seg>
<seg id=429> Everyone wants to be happy. </seg>
<seg id=430> Most people give a lot of thought as to whether their marriage is happy or not. </seg>
<seg id=431> But a really happy marriage is not based on surface conditions. </seg>
<seg id=432> Along with the birth of romance movies and TV dramas in modern China, all girls have been played up as noble princesses and portrayed as money worshippers. </seg>
<seg id=433> This is how they raise their ratings. Or, we could say that these directors just going with the flow, that they are only imitating each other in themes and style? </seg>
<seg id=434> In short, these types of movies and TV programs have unwittingly distorted the character of many a Chinese girl. </seg>
<seg id=435> Many girls feel it is perfectly justifiable to beat and scold their boyfriends or husbands. </seg>
<seg id=436> They think the husband should serve them unconditionally. Men are willing to spend money on women. If he loves you, then he will spend money on you. As a result, incorrect values have been formed. </seg>
<seg id=437> We have to admit, some men today have been affected by these popular trends and have become slaves to women. </seg>
<seg id=438> Yet, most men cannot stand such torment and they have abandoned their girlfriends or wives. </seg>
<seg id=439> That is also one of the major causes of the soaring divorce rate in China now. </seg>
<seg id=440> Many well-matched couples have broken up because of this. </seg>
<seg id=441> Many married couples have ended up in divorce although they could have been very affectionate to each other. </seg>
<seg id=442> This is very sad. </seg>
<seg id=443> Yet, there are still lots of girls that continue to naively think that they should be forgiven unconditionally for their own mistakes, and that accommodation should be made for their own self-indulgences, and think this is loving themselves. The stories of these types of girls will eventually end in tragedy. </seg>
<seg id=444> We should realize that real happiness or true joy is not built on the sufferings of others. </seg>
<seg id=445> People are equal from birth, and no one should have the right to bully and oppress others. </seg>
<seg id=446> No matter how kind someone is, no one could bear to let someone else bully them around unconditionally. </seg>
<seg id=447> The nature of human emotion is just like a spring, the more it is compresses, the more push back it will have. </seg>
<seg id=448> Don’t do to others what you don’t want others to do to you. </seg>
<seg id=449> Someone that truly loves you will frankly tell you about your shortcomings and mistakes. </seg>
<seg id=450> If he neglects your mistakes although he has seen them, his love for you cannot be considered true love. </seg>
<seg id=451> He is only deceiving you, he is playing with you. If a girl just wants to find a man who can lull her all day long, everyday, then she probably will not have real happiness. </seg>
<seg id=452> The present society is dominated by material desires, and most people just seek ephemeral enjoyment and satisfaction. It has become common fare for both men and women to speak dastardly things and commit dubious acts. </seg>
<seg id=453> Many men just regard girls as tools to release their desires and bear them children. They think girls have to be tricked so they can achieve their purpose of getting what they want. And it is exactly this type of thinking that has made many girls gradually lose their trust in love. </seg>
<seg id=454> Many unrealistic things have become their reality, such as material possessions and tricking girls. </seg>
<seg id=455> Marx once said, marriage without love is prostitution in disguise. </seg>
<seg id=456> But it seems most of the marriages in China these days are based on material possessions. </seg>
<seg id=457> That is also why lots of girl are starting to favor old men. </seg>
<seg id=458> Because old men have lots of material possession and are good at tricking girls. </seg>
<seg id=459> People are gradually losing the correct definition of love. Real love is not based on spoofing. Real love is not because you have good looks, or you have a good stature. </seg>
<seg id=460> Real love is based on mutual attraction, mutual respect, mutual support, and mutual care and concern. </seg>
<seg id=461> A truly harmonious marriage is built on the contributions of both man and women. </seg>
<seg id=462> It does not matter if the man is responsible for putting bread on the table while the women takes care of the domestic affairs or if both of them are responsible for supplying the necessities of life, only harmony can lead to a long-lasting relationship. Only those that have true love can have a happy life. </seg>
<seg id=463> Voice of America Plans to Stop Broadcasting Chinese Radio and TV Programs </seg>
<seg id=464> Voice of America Plans to Stop Broadcasting Chinese Radio and TV Programs </seg>
<seg id=465> Report by Deutsche Welle website on February 15 </seg>
<seg id=466> Original title: Voice of America to Cancel its Chinese Broadcasting and TV Programs </seg>
<seg id=467> Voice of America will cancel its broadcasting and TV programs in Mandarin Chinese and Cantonese, it will only keep its Chinese website, and will make substantial layoffs. </seg>
<seg id=468> On February 14, the U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors submitted its fiscal 2012 budget report to Congress, which includes the aforementioned financial cuts. </seg>
<seg id=469> According to the said proposal, as of October 1 this year, Voice of America will stop all its Mandarin shortwave, medium-wave, and satellite TV broadcasts, and cancel its Cantonese broadcasting completely. The proposal also includes the dismissal 45 workers, 38 of which are in the Mandarin program team. </seg>
<seg id=470> The current staff in the VOA Mandarin program team is 69 people in total. </seg>
<seg id=471> This scheme of U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors was proposed after Obama announced the U.S. government's budget program for fiscal year 2012. </seg>
<seg id=472> Voice of America is a government institution under the supervision and control of U.S. Broadcasting Board of Governors. VOA was established in 1942 and is one of the best known Chinese broadcasting institutions in the world. </seg>
<seg id=473> This decision will signify the end of an era. </seg>
<seg id=474> Taking Public Transportation or Riding a Bike Should Become Standard Assessment Criteria for Public Officials </seg>
<seg id=475> Official cars have become a nuisance in Chinese society. </seg>
<seg id=476> It is not only that official cars have caused traffic jams, but some passengers in official cars are driving in on a high horse, causing resentment from the public which in turn is contributing to social instability as well. </seg>
<seg id=477> In fact, official cars are unnecessary in most cases. Leading officials should set the example and bike to work or take public transportation. </seg>
<seg id=478> And not only that, we should also make whether they ride a bike or take public transportation a general standard in assessing public officials. </seg>
<seg id=479> In western developed countries, it is quite common for local officials to go to work by public transportation or by bike. </seg>
<seg id=480> For example, Dukakis, the then governor of Massachusetts State and presidential candidate, used to take the Boston subway to work. </seg>
<seg id=481> Bloomberg, ex-mayor of New York, also used to ride the public buses. </seg>
<seg id=482> Recently, in the campaign against traffic jams in London, the mayor took the lead and started riding a bike to work. </seg>
<seg id=483> Why can’t our public officials do the same? </seg>
<seg id=484> Beijing has 700,000 official cars. </seg>
<seg id=485> If we count one car for each official on average, that makes 700,000 cadres, the number is even greater than the population of Boston. </seg>
<seg id=486> So many public officials! </seg>
<seg id=487> So many officials having official cars has caused serious congestion in the city, not to mention that it deviates from propriety and is a detachment from the plight of the people. </seg>
<seg id=488> Official cars are a means of separating public officials from the common people, so, we should essentially abolish this practice. </seg>
<seg id=489> Just imagine the kind of message we would be sending if we made taking public transportation or riding a bike to work a standard criteria in assessing public officials. </seg>
<seg id=490> I would say that this is a good way to build up a harmonious society and correct the tendency to seek GDP growth at any cost. </seg>
<seg id=491> If a leading official has governed a place so badly that complaints are heard everywhere and popular indignation is rampant, he or she will be afraid to take public transportation or ride a bike in the street. </seg>
<seg id=492> The reason why London's mayor can ride a bike calmly in the street is exactly because the city under his administration has good public safety and the general public is happy in their life and work, so no one would stop him in the street on his way to work. </seg>
<seg id=493> How can an official that does not dare to go down the street or ride a public bus in the place under his administration still be eligible for public office? </seg>
<seg id=494> Historically, any place where the government officials walk freely is a quite modern and well-governed place. </seg>
<seg id=495> For example, the European boroughs or urban countries in the Middle Ages were the cradle of capitalism and were the most advanced in both economy and culture. </seg>
<seg id=496> From Florence and Venice to Bruges and Amsterdam, at least in the golden age, city officials rubbed shoulders with the citizens in the street every day, just like fish and water. </seg>
<seg id=497> And that is also one of the major reasons why the citizens trusted the government. </seg>
<seg id=498> As everyone knows, if an official implements perverse policies, he will have no way to survive in such an environment. </seg>
<seg id=499> In fact, this type of relationship between fish and water can also compel officials to behave well. </seg>
<seg id=500> It is a good means to fight against corruption. </seg>
<seg id=501> In building a harmonious society, the key is not in empty sayings, but in doing. </seg>
<seg id=502> How should we do this? </seg>
<seg id=503> Leading officials should take public transportation or ride a bike, and form relationship with the general public like fish have with water. </seg>
<seg id=504> We can only talk about other things once this first step is taken. </seg>
<seg id=505> If public officials cannot live in harmony with the general public in the street or daily life, then how can we have a harmonious society? </seg>
<seg id=506> Japanese Senior Citizens' Greatest Happiness During New Year </seg>
<seg id=507> Many Chinese tourists have been to Japan, and many of them have told me things like: "Elderly Japanese people are really diligent, some are driving taxis, some are cleaning hotel rooms, and some are working as security guards for commercial mansions. They look very very old, but they work so hard every day, regardless of whether they serve a high purpose or not!" </seg>
<seg id=508> Indeed, such old people as those in Beijing who go to the nearby park to play with their birds or exercise their vocal chords can hardly be seen in Tokyo. </seg>
<seg id=509> Let's take some other examples, such as Tai Chi that elderly Chinese people like to do in the early morning, it is purely a luxury in the eyes of elderly Japanese people! </seg>
<seg id=510> Most of them cannot afford it. </seg>
<seg id=511> According to Japanese law, elderly males and females above 75 years old may continue to drive a car, but they should attach a red leaf sign on the car. </seg>
<seg id=512> If we try to put a positive meaning on it, this sign is called "red leaf", but if we make the meaning negative, then we call this the "fallen leaf" sign. Just as the metaphor goes, it signifies an old person who is dying, of course it is a bad term! </seg>
<seg id=513> According to statistics, people over 75 at fault for traffic accidents last year increased by 1.5 times verses 10 years ago. However, for cars with the "red leaf" signs, the increase was less than 35%. So, in order to improve traffic management, the National Police Agency of Japan had decided to make it compulsory for elderly people to attach the "red leaf" sign on their cars from June 2008, and those violating this rule will be fined or face other punitive actions. </seg>
<seg id=514> But who would have known that although the elderly Japanese people stick together, that they would firmly oppose the whole business with the "fallen leaf" signs, feeling that this action greatly defiles a society that respects its seniors and doing such a thing is intolerable. </seg>
<seg id=515> As a result, the National Police Agency of Japan finally changed its mind by Christmas Day, rescinding the rule that made adding of the "red leaf" sign compulsory and have returned to returning to the original principle of allowing the elderly to voluntary paste it. </seg>
<seg id=516> An elderly Japanese man said: "It's so nice not having to paste the sign! It the greatest joy I have had all year!" </seg>
<seg id=517> After he said that, the old man suddenly stepped on the gas and the car roared away, as if flying off! </seg>
<seg id=518> The following picture shows the “fallen leaf” attached to an elderly man's car. </seg>
<seg id=519> In fact, if there had been no news about Ai lijima’s suicide on Christmas Eve that year, the topic about old people's being allowed to drive a car without pasting the "red leaf" sign would have been a major story in the Japanese mass media. Yet, it had no power to win against the public sediment and the curiosity and shock at the self-destruction of a beauty in the end. So it seems that from then and up till now that Japanese society is not so keen on whether the elderly are happy or not, well, at least it would appear that way. </seg>
<seg id=520> In contrast, although Ai lijima was found as late as one week after her death, the blog she wrote before her death has not stopped blowing up and condolences continue to pour in from the commentary column on the site. </seg>
<seg id=521> For details, see Ai Iijima’s blog below. </seg>

<seg id=523> Charming Female Performers in the Nepalese Maoist Art Troupe (Picture) </seg>
<seg id=524> The Chinese army has art troupes, such as the Art Troupe of the Political Department of the Air Force, the Art Troupe of the Political Department of the Navy, and the Art Troupe of the General Political Department. In local areas, there are art troupes for each major military region: in the Shenyang Military Region, there is Qianxian; in the Jinan Military Region, there is Qianwei; in the Nanjing Military Region, there is Qianxian; in the Fuzhou Military Region, there is Qianfeng; in the Beijing Military Region, there is Zhanyou; in the Guangzhou Military Region, there is Zhanshi; in the Chengdu Military Region, there is Zhanqi; in the Lanzhou Military Region, there is Zhandou. </seg>
<seg id=525> As the story goes, all these names were approved by Chairman Mao, therefore, they have been used to this day. </seg>
<seg id=526> I, Qin Quanyao, the owner of this blog, used to live in Dengshikou in the East District of Beijing. When I studied at the No. 25 Middle School, the east gate of our school faced directly opposite the Kong Zheng Art Troupe. </seg>
<seg id=527> Yah, the performers in the art troupe were so pretty! They would immediately become the spotlight of attention once they set foot on the street. </seg>
<seg id=528> It was really great! </seg>
<seg id=529> At that time, I wrote a song to the tune of Dongfang Hong: The east is crimson, the sun is rising, as China's beauties come out from Kong Zheng. </seg>
<seg id=530> Wherever there is an art troupe, hoo-rah, people can enjoy the exquisite beauty. </seg>
<seg id=531> Nepal Communist Party has a Maoist Armed Forces, and they have also set up an art troupe in Chinese fashion. </seg>
<seg id=532> Whenever there is a big assembly for the organization, such as summaries of the General Assembly, swearing-in ceremonies, or award ceremonies, the finale is a theatrical performance from the art troupe. </seg>
<seg id=533> The contents of the programs are, of course, singing the praises of the organization, singing the praises of the great leaders, and extolling Prachanda as the Red Sun. </seg>
<seg id=534> Prachanda attaches great importance to the performance of the art troupe. Before the performance, he often offers guidance in person, and after the performance, he will appear on the stage to interview them. </seg>
<seg id=535> Under this type of backdrop, how can the members of the art troupe help shedding tears? </seg>
<seg id=536> Just like in China, the female performers in the art troupe are also extremely pretty. </seg>
<seg id=537> They are from all over of Nepal, they perform the most unique singing and dancing, and of course, there are Sherpa girls very similar to Tibetan beauties... </seg>
<seg id=538> The performance is arranged very well, and every official wears a head portrait of Prachanda on their chest to maintain order. </seg>
<seg id=539> Migrant Workers Looking for Their Children at Zunyi Railway Station </seg>
<seg id=540> They are migrant workers from nearby counties and cities doing temporary jobs in Zunyi, and all of their children have been kidnapped within this past year by abduction and trafficking gangs. None of them knows the whereabouts of their children to this day. </seg>
<seg id=541> They have a very resolute attitude, they say there is only one thing they will until their dying day, they must find their children. </seg>
<seg id=542> We hope every reader will help spread this message, and we hope the criminals will be captured soon so that these families can be reunited. </seg>

<seg id=545> "Politics of Meritorious Statesmen Offspring” Reflected in the Story of Zhou Yafu from Chinese History </seg>
<seg id=546> In Chinese history, traditional politics generally included five stages: politics of meritorious statesmen, politics of meritorious statesmen offspring, politics of good statesmen, politics of treacherous statesmen, and politics of sycophantic statesmen. </seg>
<seg id=547> Therefore, we can also say this exemplifies the progression described in the proverb: "A gentleman's glory cannot last more than five generations". </seg>
<seg id=548> Amongst other examples, the politics of meritorious statesmen's offspring was clearly shown as early as the beginning of the Han Dynasty. </seg>
<seg id=549> Zhou Yafu was one such representative example. </seg>
<seg id=550> When a meritorious statesman assisted the highest ruler in seizing power over the country, his offspring usually also took an important part in the process (except for feudal dynasties established by ethnic minorities such as Mongolians during the Yuan Dynasty and Manchurians during the Qing Dynasty). </seg>
<seg id=551> Yet, his growth was also coupled with the momentum of the meritorious statesman in his deeds of governing the whole country. </seg>
<seg id=552> This had given the meritorious statesmen offspring many chances for training and going beyond what most people were offered. </seg>
<seg id=553> Why could Zhou Bo lead his royal guards to put down the rebellion by the Lu Clan, and why could Zhou Yafu suppress the seven rebellious states? None of those instances were accidental. </seg>
<seg id=554> Even the final outcome of the father and son was not accidental. </seg>
<seg id=555> The development from politics of meritorious statesmen to politics of meritorious statesmen offspring was an inevitable trend for an place like China with such traditions in history and politics, usually no one could stand in the way of such a thing. </seg>
<seg id=556> Therefore, there was nothing strange about it, and it would have been self-defeating to think so. </seg>
<seg id=557> However, in comparison with politics of meritorious statesmen, politics of meritorious statesmen offspring is, after all, somewhat inferior. </seg>
<seg id=558> The reason is that no matter what, meritorious statesmen offspring had different experiences that shaped their backgrounds from those of the meritorious statesmen. </seg>
<seg id=559> Although they had learned some of the strong points of the meritorious statesmen, yet, they could not match some of their strong points or life experiences. </seg>
<seg id=560> After all, the offspring of meritorious statesmen grew up as nobles, their cognition of hardships and sufferings was limited only to the oral accounts or memories of their predecessors, they had no intuitive understanding of what hardships really are. </seg>
<seg id=561> Therefore, the teaching they often received about hardships was usually only some general presentation, and it was nowhere near substantive cognition. </seg>
<seg id=562> Emperor Xuanzong of the Ming Dynasty, Zhu Zhanji, followed his grandpapa Zhu Di several times on northern expeditions, but he would not even have a taste of what the commoners were eating. </seg>
<seg id=563> (His mother, the Queen Mother, ate two mouthfuls, but Zhu Zhanji did not eat any at all. </seg>
<seg id=564> This is precisely the difference. </seg>
<seg id=565> Zhou Bo's imprisonment was owing to the emperor's jealousy and suspiciousness, and Zhou himself had shown no sign of arrogance to be used by others as an excuse for persecution. </seg>
<seg id=566> However, Zhou Yafu's stretching his hand out towards Emperor Jing of the Han Dynasty to ask for chopsticks was certainly a breach of etiquette, but it was normal for Zhou Yafu given his background. </seg>
<seg id=567> In fact, it was really common behavior of politics of meritorious statesmen offspring. </seg>
<seg id=568> The haughtiness in their hearts could come out at anytime, and they could disguise it. </seg>
<seg id=569> It should be said that, the insights and abilities of meritorious statesmen offspring were quite outstanding in most cases, yet, naturally, they also showed many faults from time to time. </seg>
<seg id=570> Then, what measures can be taken to prevent the political risks of the meritorious statesmen offspring? </seg>
<seg id=571> That question applies to democratic systems, but it was only an castle in the sky during the feudal age. </seg>
<seg id=572> The advantage of the democratic system is not that it can stop accidents, but that it can prevent major political catastrophes, or, if a major catastrophe does occur, there is still some room to mitigate some of the losses. </seg>
<seg id=573> Anyway, this is another topic. </seg>
<seg id=574> Comrade Jiang Qing </seg>
<seg id=575> On January 25, 1981, after the trial, the Special Court of the Supreme People's Court sentenced the ten principal offenders of Lin Biao and Jiang Qing’s Counter-revolutionary Clique as follows: </seg>
<seg id=576> Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao were sentenced to death, with a two-year stay of execution, with permanent deprivation of political rights; </seg>
<seg id=577> Wang Hongwen was sentenced to life imprisonment, with permanent deprivation of political rights; </seg>
<seg id=578> The seven other criminals were sentenced to fixed-term imprisonment: Yao Wenyuan, 20-year imprisonment; Chen Baida, 18-year imprisonment; Huang Yongsheng, 18-year imprisonment; Wu Faxian, 17-year imprisonment; Li Zuopeng, 18-year imprisonment; Qiu Huizuo, 16-year imprisonment; Jiang Tengjiao, 18-year imprisonment. All of them were deprived of political rights for five years. </seg>
<seg id=579> Introduction: Why Do We Question Why Shanghai Jiaotong University Offered Luc Montagnier a Professorship? </seg>
<seg id=580> On 22th December last year, “People's Daily” reported Luc Montagnier, one of the winners of Nobel Prize in medical physiology (Luc Montagnier is also translated as “Lu-ke Meng-ta-ni-ye”, see Wikipedia), accepted Shanghai Jiaotong University’s professorship offer. This news has attracted a lot of attention, as there have not been many examples of Nobel Prize winners becoming full-time professors in China. </seg>
<seg id=581> Pictures of mass media reports after Montagnier won the Nobel Prize </seg>
<seg id=582> However, this seemingly happy news has caused a lot of doubt and even criticism from scholars and critics inside China because Montagnier, who had made some contributions in AIDs research, has strayed away from convention. One example includes his clinical test for autism treatment called “Unorthodox Test Methods for Autism” (see the report in Nature). He is also obsessed by so-called molecular homeopathy, which is also a controversial issue that has not been endorsed by most scientists in the research field. Some professors even pointed out that there are some pseudoscience elements in Montagnier’s research. </seg>
<seg id=583> Later, Science magazine conducted an exclusive interview with Montagnier (retold in “Yin Shui Si Yuan” of Shanghai Jiaotong University), which used a meaningful title “French Nobelist Escapes ‘Intellectual Terror’ to Pursue Radical Ideas in China”. </seg>
<seg id=584> Obviously, the editor of Science was not completely satisfied with the interview from a conventional academic standpoint, and Montagnier’s answer couldn’t dispel these doubts or explain them clearly, which only left people with a lot of “room for their imaginations to roam”. </seg>
<seg id=585> In fact, the questions in discussion covered the details of the experiments, and moreover, his status as a laureate has also puzzled China’s mass media and ordinary people as they try to understand the event. We think that what we should do now is not just talk about these questions, we should also take a long “look” and substantively conclude how to make sense of what Montagnier’s research is about and how we should interpret his research. </seg>
<seg id=586> On this issue, some Chinese scientists in the Society of Squirrels in Science talked seriously about this matter in private. They have some new questions after repeatedly reading of his most recent three papers. They have finished 2 papers, “Physics Without Discussion of Details is Pseudoscience” and “Amazing Story in Biology: Not Knowing Where DNA Is From”. The papers discuss the loopholes in Montagnier’s experiments and theory from different subjects, and will be released to the public in the following two days as “Reviewer Comments” to help readers and the mass media interested in this matter comprehend this event better. </seg>

<seg id=589> Greatest Dialogue in History Between Planners: Dialogue between Haimo and He Xuelin </seg>
<seg id=590> Between March 6 to March 8, 2011, a super dialogue lasting three days and nights was carried out at Beijing Caizhi International Mansion between Haimo, writer and planner, and He Xuelin, a great planner who became famous because of his successful scheme for Shi Yuzhu's comeback. </seg>
<seg id=591> This dialogue comprehensively reviewed and summarized Mr. He Xuelin's two-decade long practices in planning. They had very creative and constructive conversations on some front-edge topics, such as the present situation and future, opportunities and predicaments of China's planning industry. </seg>
<seg id=592> This "Hai-He Dialogue" is reputed to be "The Greatest Dialogue in History between Planners" because of the comprehensiveness of the contents, the profundity of the language, and the length of time all set new historical records. </seg>
<seg id=593> What topic made Haimo's facial expression become so solemn and full of intensity? </seg>
<seg id=594> Haimo was talking intensely with Mr. He Xuelin on the current status and future of China's planning industry. </seg>

<seg id=605> There are more and more activities in various circles in Beijing, but few of them have produced any real influence or effect. </seg>
<seg id=606> Most of them just gather people of all kinds together in a "cross-circle", but what they lack are substantive contents or the subtext of what a cultural event should have. </seg>

<seg id=612> Will There be a Sequel to “I Am Number Four”? </seg>
<seg id=613> When I watched movies as a child, I always let my imagination wander as to what came next after the film ended. Later, I came to realize that this was the deliberate intention of the author, script writer, and director… </seg>
<seg id=614> In “I Am Number Four”, we see extraterrestrial beings coming to the Earth, the reason is not clear though. Why do they protect the earth? There is no answer. The chase throughout the movie resembles the kind of resentment or old grudges found in Chinese martial-art storylines… </seg>
<seg id=615> Nothing is left out of “I Am Number Four”, from Number Three being killed in the wilderness, to  how the Internet is used, to legends of alien space, to high-tech weapons, to wrestling with school life in America, to forging certificates, and so on… </seg>
<seg id=616> Chasing Number Four is the main storyline of the whole film. It’s sort of like the main storyline in Harry Potter VII: “Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows” in which Harry Potter was being protected… </seg>
<seg id=617> In “I Am Number Four”, there are many guardians for Number Four, which adds to the mystical tale. In general though, we comprehend the prevalence of the task system, but it’s more like a PK in a  super game than anything else… </seg>
<seg id=618> Watching “I Am Number Four” is an okay way to spend part of your weekend, although it’s not as exciting as a major movie event. However, a lot of these types of movies resemble Chinese martial-art fight scenes. If Chinese movies emphasize kungfu, US movies focus even more on high-tech integration... </seg>
<seg id=619> “I Am Number Four” leaves us no real ending. Sort of like Harry Potter VII, there will be a sequel… </seg>
<seg id=620> Time to Bet Big on Integrating Online Games with Mobile Phones </seg>
<seg id=621> Article by Zhang Shule. Tan Qunzhao, CEO of Shanda Games Ltd., indicated that Shanda will expand its offerings from the PC platform to the mobile Internet platform. </seg>
<seg id=622> However, nearly all top online game companies have presented similar ideas yet none of them produced any results up to now. Since the cake for online game companies is still tasty, that is, online games are still profitable enough, none of them have really ventured out into mobile Internet games. </seg>
<seg id=623> Looking at the big picture, expanding business into mobile Internet is a good opportunity for online games, but this idea still remains at the conceptual level. </seg>
<seg id=624> In fact, this idea of integrating online games with the mobile Internet has been talked about for more than just the last year or two. So then why hasn’t there been any growth? The main problem is that an appropriate method for combining the two has not been found yet, so, embedding online games into mobile phones is restricted by many factors such as mobile phone models and network speeds. </seg>
<seg id=625> But no one has been able to come up with a plan to develop this potential. </seg>
<seg id=626> In my opinion, the point at which web games and mobile Internet will be integrated really depends on web games. That is, it is up to web games or online games to find a way to integrate with mobile terminals and open up access between the two platforms in 2011. The reason is that the web games is applicable to iPad and other similar types of equipment, e-books, laptops, mobile phones, and other devices for the mobile Internet use. </seg>
<seg id=627> Moreover, if it is indeed offered to the correct demographics, the profitability will also be higher, no matter if the games are offered for free with advertisement revenue providing the profits or if there is a charge for each game. </seg>
<seg id=628> What’s more, online game companies have slowed at the moment. At present, some video websites have started to find their way into online games too. </seg>
<seg id=629> Video websites engage in online games by bringing user to web games in order to actually find some profit points out of the money-burning videos and the great number of users. Since the overall development cost of web games is not high, these companies would rather develop such games themselves than advertise for others. </seg>
<seg id=630> Adding to all this is that pretty much any site that has traffic can attempt to operate their own web games, not just video websites. </seg>
<seg id=631> There have been some more successful cases, for example, video-on-demand PPS. The time is just right for video websites to enter this market. </seg>
<seg id=632> On the whole, the year 2011 is a promising year for the online game industry. </seg>
<seg id=633> The reason for a decline in revenue for online games is not that users are not playing the games but that online game companies have started to place a lot of emphasize on research and development. Therefore, there is sure to be an upswing in the online game industry. </seg>

<seg id=635> Are Children Today More Unhappy? </seg>
<seg id=636> Yesterday I read a report on the “quality of childhood” from the UK, which concluded that children today are more unhappy. </seg>
<seg id=637> The reasons are that, first, the divorce rate today is higher, and second, more mothers today are working away from the home. </seg>
<seg id=638> If these two reasons are so significant, then how are our children supposed to live happy lives? How many mothers are willing to give up their work for their children? </seg>
<seg id=639> Pushkin City (the Royal Village) – French-Style Gardens </seg>
<seg id=640> Pushkin City, which was a manor for the royal families of the past, is a town 24 km from the southern suburb of St. Petersburg. </seg>
<seg id=641> In fact, this area is comprised of two parts: Alexander Park and Catherine Park. </seg>
<seg id=642> Today, the place which tourists visit most often is the park that features Catherine Palace. </seg>
<seg id=643> With regard to Catherine Park, the landscaping can be split into two parts according the distinctive layouts in each area: </seg>
<seg id=644> one is a French-style garden that encompasses the front and rear of the palace; </seg>
<seg id=645> the other part is English-style landscaping around a large stretch of lake, which sits southwest of the palace. </seg>
<seg id=646> The French-style garden mainly features a well-planned layout that is neat, orderly, and symmetrical. This layout is applied to everything from lawn, ponds, roads, and sculpture that are in front of the palace. </seg>
<seg id=647> The vegetation in the garden are meticulously selected and planted according to the humanly-engineered patterns. Even the flowers, grass, and trees are so neatly pruned with horizontal and vertical emphasis, edges and corners that everything there seems like it is lining up to look at and bow to the master. </seg>
<seg id=648> Through the windows inside the palace, the exquisite iron gates outside Catherine Palace overlook the completely symmetrical arrangement of the garden and graceful flute players. Melodious fluting piping from the garden echoes in the air over the elegant landscape nearly all year round. </seg>
<seg id=649> The Cameron Gallery, a colonnade that people once strolled down to appreciate the scenery, is a structure with a well-knit artistic style of ancient Greece and Rome, and a model of classic European architectural style. </seg>
<seg id=650> It was built in 1779, and was named after the architect, Cameron, upon completion. </seg>
<seg id=651> The architect Charles Cameron came from Scotland. </seg>
<seg id=652> The queen sincerely loved his work because of his concise, well-balanced styles, modest and harmonious colors, and his delicate and elegant decorations. </seg>
<seg id=653> Built to complement the gently-sloping terrain in “the Royal Village”, the Cameron Gallery is completely stately and presents a transparent, radiant, and spacious ambiance. It is decorated with elaborate giant bronze statue replicas of Flora (the goddess of flowers) and Hercules (the god of strength) of ancient Greece and Rome at both sides of the front spiral staircases. </seg>
<seg id=654> By the pond there are some vendor booths that rent out ancient costumes and offer photo services. Wearing the ancient costumes seemingly transports you back to the bank of the clear pond in the 18th century. The pond is dotted with statues that give the environment a strong classical flavor. </seg>
<seg id=655> The neatly symmetrical garden road is lined with straight lindens. Found everywhere in Russia, lindens are used to make Russian dolls and other handicrafts because of its soft, light wood texture. </seg>
<seg id=656> Vegetation is spread all around this garden and lilacs are blooming in order. Plots of the same trees grow tall in Russia! </seg>
<seg id=657> 『UK』: Forcing Employee Who Stole £845 to Parade in Streets Causes Boss to Compensate £13,000 </seg>
<seg id=658> In the above picture, the person holding the sign being paraded down the street is a British man named Mark Gilbert, and the one holding Mark’s arms is his former boss Simon Cremer. </seg>
<seg id=659> In October 2008, after discovering that an employee had written a company check to himself, cashed it, and put it in his own pocket, the angry boss tied up the employee, hung a sign on him that read: “I’m a thief – I stole £845 and now I am on my way to the police station”, and then paraded him down the local streets. </seg>
<seg id=660> As a result, the employee who stole the money admitted his guilt to the police and was released shortly after being warned. </seg>
<seg id=661> The angry boss, however, was accused of illegal detention. After going to court several times, he settled out of court upon payment of £5,000 in compensation and £8,000 worth of legal costs. </seg>
<seg id=662> When interviewed by the “Daily Telegraph”, this flooring company boss was still resentful, “I think this is really terrible. He stole my money and then he can sue me! I do not want to give him a single cent after what he did. Really, this makes me feel sick. He is a thief, but I have to compensate him. This really makes me so angry.” </seg>
<seg id=663> Mark Gilbert, the floor layer who was paraded in streets, indicated that he actually also intended to continue the litigation to the end in the hopes of being awarded more psychological damages. Since he did not have enough money for appeal, however, he settled out of court and accepted the £5,000. </seg>
<seg id=664> He wrote a check to himself, not because he was greedy for money he said, but because the boss failed to pay his wages. Since he was badly in need of this money to spend the holiday, he “helped” the fearfully busy boss write this check. </seg>
<seg id=665> After this incident occurred, he moved away from this town. </seg>
<seg id=666> Hong Kong: Dating and Falling in Love at McDonalds, Why Not Hold a “Mc Wedding” There Too </seg>
<seg id=667> Hong Kongers have a new choice available to them for arranging wedding banquets. They can hold “Mc Weddings” at McDonalds. </seg>
<seg id=668> In 2011, McDonalds locations in Hong Kong now offer wedding packages. Recently, the first couple who chose to hold this type of novel ceremony held their wedding in the fast food restaurant. </seg>
<seg id=669> On Valentine’s Day 2011, a McDonald’s restaurant near the financial district in Hong Kong was full of pink balloons hanging everywhere, with a “cake” in the middle of room stacked with apple pies, on which was a pile of M-shaped memorial rings made of crystal. </seg>
<seg id=670> Blessed by relatives and friends holding McDonalds cold drinks and fast food in their hands, Kelvin and Ashley held a very distinctive engagement ceremony. </seg>
<seg id=671> They are the first couple who have taken a Hong Kong McDonalds up on its offered wedding package. McDonalds Corporation is very confident about this innovative offering. It thinks that this suits the needs of Hong Kong’s young people who are fond of having dates and falling in love at McDonalds and find the traditional wedding banquet venues too expensive. </seg>
<seg id=672> When interviewed, Shirley Chang, head of McDonalds in Hong Kong, said, “They date here (McDonalds) and have their love grow in this place. Therefore, they also choose this place for their wedding date.” </seg>
<seg id=673> This “warm, sweet wedding package” launched by McDonalds has a base price of HKD 9,999. Besides McDonalds food, this package that accommodates about 12 guests also includes wedding gifts, invitations with the symbolic yellow “Ms” of McDonalds printed on them, and various types of decorations for the event. </seg>
<seg id=674> The new couples can pay more money to rent balloon wedding dresses, balloon corsages, balloon cakes, giant pink McDonalds backgrounds, etc. </seg>
<seg id=675> This price is really more attractive than that for a wedding banquet at an average hotel in Hong Kong. Given that it will be hard for older generations to accept this new way of doing things, it is likely that in the end, McDonalds will merely serve as a place for couples who have dated and fallen in love there to hold their engagement parties; it is unlikely that it will be chosen as a wedding hall. </seg>
<seg id=676> US: New York’s Pregnant Women Privileged to Freely Park Anytime and Anywhere </seg>
<seg id=677> The pregnant women in New York will be fortunate because the government of New York is considering adopting a regulation to allow all pregnant women to park free of charge anytime, anywhere in New York. </seg>
<seg id=678> If this bill proposed by Senator David Greenfield is adopted, expectant mothers may legally park in every corner of New York City, even areas with “No Parking” signs posted so long as they hold a doctor’s statement certifying their pregnancy and request a sticker from the Department of Transportation. </seg>
<seg id=679> Moreover, wherever they park, they do not have to pay any parking fees. </seg>
<seg id=680> This privilege will extend until a month after their expected delivery dates (to ensure that pregnant women who do not give birth by their expected date can still enjoy the privilege). </seg>
<seg id=681> Mr. Greenfield put forward this proposal because he encountered many difficulties when trying to park during his wife’s two pregnancies. </seg>
<seg id=682> New York is notorious for its difficulty in finding a parking spot, there are more drivers than there are parking spots. Moreover, parking fees are very high there. </seg>
<seg id=683> Although each parking lot provides some parking spaces for “Expectant Mothers” only, they still cannot find parking spaces sometimes. </seg>
<seg id=684> Therefore, he thinks that the government should adopt this measure to ensure that every pregnant woman can conveniently park. </seg>
<seg id=685> Similar regulations have long been implemented in the State of Georgia and the State of Oklahoma, but not in New York. </seg>
<seg id=686> Not all the New Yorkers are in total agreement with this proposal. Many people have left messages saying that they oppose the move on the New York Daily News website. </seg>
<seg id=687> Some people consider this to be gender discrimination. For them, special treatment is not necessary because being pregnant is not a physical disability. </seg>
<seg id=688> Since they are able to drive themselves, why should they enjoy special treatment which the disabled are not even entitled to? </seg>
<seg id=689> As precious resources in New York, parking spaces should not be given to pregnant women like this. </seg>
<seg id=690> Other people indicate that the government should pay pregnant women money to take a taxi since it wants to care for them. </seg>
<seg id=691> In any case, it is difficult for pregnant women to drive. So giving them money to take a taxi is better than solving their parking problem. This way, the taxi driver can also help carry things or whatever else. </seg>
<seg id=692> In fact, this reminds me of the discussions in China not too long ago about whether one should offer their seat to the elderly (and the pregnant) during rush hour. </seg>
<seg id=693> At the time, some voiced their opinions on the Internet and said such things as: “Why do the elderly compete with office workers for seats since they are retired” and “Why not just get pregnant if you can’t afford taxi fare”. </seg>
<seg id=694> As a matter of fact, giving preferential free parking to pregnant women in the US and offering seats to pregnant women in China, in essence, are the same thing. What do all of you think? Should we give them this special treatment? </seg>
<seg id=695> Film “Don Quixote” Makes My Tear Up </seg>
<seg id=696> Although it is sort of too late to comment on a film that was released during October of last year, few Chinese films can find their way in the foreign cinemas and even “Let the Bullets Fly” has not successfully flown to Singapore, so how did this film? </seg>
<seg id=697> I saw this film on a Singapore Airlines flight to Japan. As for this film itself, this is an extremely bad 3D film. The film producer seemingly learned how to produce a 3D film rather than create one. </seg>
<seg id=698> In addition, some of the vulgar plots in the film take it farther and farther away from ever becoming a classic. </seg>
<seg id=699> In spite of all these shortcomings, however, the success of this files script cannot be denied, nor can the brilliance in the great human nature of the character Don Quixote be outdone. </seg>
<seg id=700> At the end of this film, in particular, the impassioned speech by Don actually made me tear up. </seg>
<seg id=701> After seeing this film, Don Quixote is the person I now respect the most. He, despite being a fictitious figure, touched me deeply with his almost crazed pursuit of his dream. </seg>
<seg id=702> From time immemorial, many people have pursued similar things. Once someone pursues their dream in their own particular way, they are deemed impractical and even crazy. </seg>
<seg id=703> I also have had a similar experience, I think, so I teared up. I seldom complain because society does not sympathize with losers. I can but constantly endeavor to prove myself without giving up my dream. Do you know how hard it is? </seg>
<seg id=704> For my second book, I have tentatively set the title as “Around the World in 80 Days” and plan on using “Purchase Dream Rather Than Housing” as the subheading. I just intend to let everyone know how happy it is to pursue a dream. </seg>
<seg id=705> It is just like what Steven Chow said: “Better to be a salted fish than someone without a dream”. </seg>
<seg id=706> So then, what’s your dream? What dream did you have as a child? </seg>
<seg id=707> What are you doing today? </seg>
<seg id=708> The same questions are also raised in the film “Mr. Deeds” that features Adam Sandler. </seg>
<seg id=709> It’s no wonder that my favorite films to watch star Chow and Adam. </seg>
<seg id=710> Today, Guo Tao also asked this question. Well then, what is your answer? </seg>
<seg id=711> At the end of this film, Sancho unexpectedly fights against a windmill. This ending is more impressive than the original work. </seg>
<seg id=712> Let’s pursue our dreams although we may make some mistakes. </seg>

<seg id=714> Material Warehouse Management System </seg>
<seg id=715> I. After sourced materials (including purchased raw materials, spare parts, etc) arrive, a representative from the Supply Department shall fill out a "Receipt of Goods Form" in quadruplicate </seg>
<seg id=716> (After a member of the warehouse management staff signs the "Receipt of Goods Form", one copy shall be kept by the Supply Department, one copy shall be submitted to the Inspection Department, one copy shall be submitted to the Finance Department, and one copy shall be used by the warehouse as a basis for issuing the "Warehouse Entry Form"). </seg>
<seg id=717> Warehouse management staff shall check that all the goods are received in good order by referring to the names of the goods and their specifications, quantities, and unit prices listed on the "Receipt of Goods Form", after which time the management staff can sign the "Receipt of Goods Form" . </seg>
<seg id=718> A warehouse manager shall fill out the "Warehouse Entry Form" in triplicate according to the results of the check on received goods, the delivery person shall check the goods against the items on the "Warehouse Entry Form" with a member of the warehouse management staff, and after confirming that there are no discrepancies, shall sign the "Warehouse Entry Form" to ensure that the information listed in the document is the same as the goods received. </seg>
<seg id=719> A warehouse manager shall place the goods into the physical inventory account of the warehouse according to the copies of the completed "Receipt of Goods Form" (copy for warehouse entry) and the "Warehouse Entry Form" and then submit one copy to the Finance Department and one copy to the Supply Department. </seg>
<seg id=720> II. When the finished goods produced by the enterprise itself enter the warehouse, said goods must be accompanied by a "Product Quality Certificate of Conformity" issued by the Quality Control Department. This certificate shall be submitted to a warehouse manager by a person specifically assigned to the task. </seg>
<seg id=721> The warehouse manager shall fill out the "Warehouse Entry Form" in triplicate according to the condition of the goods that are entering the warehouse. </seg>
<seg id=722> After both roles ensure that there are no discrepancies, they shall sign the "Warehouse Entry Form". </seg>
<seg id=723> After signing, one copy of the "Warehouse Entry Form" shall serve as the basis for registering the goods into the physical inventory account of the warehouse, one copy shall be submitted to the production workshop as basis for production statistics, and one copy shall be handed in to the Finance Department as basis for cost accounting and accounting of finished goods. </seg>
<seg id=724> III. Warehouse entry and exit procedures for sourced materials that are received directly by the production workshop to fulfill production requirements shall be handled at the same time. Adhering to these procedures will help provide an accurate record of the flow of goods through the enterprise. </seg>
<seg id=725> IV. In the event that excess items need to be removed from the workshop, the “Procedure List for Material Removal” shall be filled out in triplicate, and a detailed description of the cause shall be given in the "remarks" column. </seg>
<seg id=726> In the event that materials need to be returned at the end of the month, the material requests for the next month shall be gone through at the same time that the procedures for returning the goods are being initiated. </seg>
<seg id=727> V. If discrepancies in quantity, quality, specifications, product type, or similar are found during the acceptance process or warehouse entry procedures, a warehouse manager shall have the right to refuse completing the warehouse entry procedures, and shall, according to the particulars surrounding the situation, report the case to the Supply Department, Production Department, and top executives so that the matter can be dealt with further. </seg>
<seg id=728> Sector Leads Index to Hit 3,000 </seg>
<seg id=729> The index fell slightly yesterday to close at a price which was higher than the opening price but lower than the price from the previous day’s close. The index remained negative. </seg>
<seg id=730> A net outflow of funds totaled 9.502 billion Yuan in Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets, in which 1.695 billion Yuan was from institutions and 7.807 billion Yuan from retail investors. </seg>
<seg id=731> There were slight rises after the indexes opened low. After 10:15, they started to plunge rapidly and continuously, and at one point fell below 5-day and 10-day moving averages. </seg>
<seg id=732> However, after falling below 2,897 points, the intersecting point for the 5-day and 10-day moving averages, buying below became active and the indexes started to push up at 14:15 p.m. In the end, they slightly fell to close at a price which was higher than the same day’s opening price but lower than the price from the previous day’s close. The index remained negative. </seg>
<seg id=733> Ideally, for this day, the market indexes will rise significantly again and reach new heights. </seg>
<seg id=734> If the indexes decline moderately to close, they will have trouble in the short term. </seg>
<seg id=735> Regardless, they must reach 3,000 points. </seg>
<seg id=736> Let’s take a look at some hot spots. Yesterday’s hot spots switched quickly, and trading of bio-medicine stocks in early trading was active. This sector, which we discussed several times in the log earlier, always performs actively in the face of extraordinary events involving index volatility. According to the description of the log near to the 10th day, the stock price of Guangzhou Pharmaceutical hit the limit while that of BBCA Pharmaceutical remained stagnant. </seg>
<seg id=737> Additionally, the benefits of the policy for low-income housing in the property stock sector, which was discussed in yesterday’s article before trading, caused some stock to post significant increases. </seg>
<seg id=738> We insist on our yesterday’s view that it is imperative for real estate, finance (banks, securities traders and insurance), non-ferrous, and other industries to act as the spearheads for the index to break the 3,000 beachhead. </seg>
<seg id=739> How to Operate After the Central Bank Raises Interest </seg>
<seg id=740> The People’s Bank of China decided to raise the benchmark interest rates on RMB savings and loans for financial institutions as of February 9, 2011. </seg>
<seg id=741> Financial institutions will raise their benchmark interest rates on one-year savings and loans by 0.25 percentage points. </seg>
<seg id=742> As we know, the increase in interest rates is not aimed directly at stock markets, but is attributed to inflation. </seg>
<seg id=743> In fact, since the required reserves were first raised this year, the policy has set the obvious tone. The policy has set a basic cadence: raise the required reserves – raise the interest rates – continue to raise the reserve fund …Clearly, this has already caused the largest rises in stocks. </seg>
<seg id=744> Therefore, if an increase in interest is now deemed to make profits, this notion will be laughed at. </seg>
<seg id=745> The current stock market faces an increasingly complex dice game. Many previous laws are not obviously applicable to the current stock market because many policies, which do not directly influence the stock market are exerting stronger and stronger impact on the stock market. Furthermore, the game of stock index futures will become more complicated. </seg>
<seg id=746> I believe that the days of trading thus far in 2011 have allowed everyone to fully experience the difficulties in maneuvering. </seg>
<seg id=747> Hence, when trading stocks, investors should carefully think things though and think positively rather than simply believe some outdated indicators. </seg>
<seg id=748> During the Spring Festival, US stocks continuously rose and many traders expected to take advantage of the market as soon as the trading bells rang. </seg>
<seg id=749> This afternoon, market makers were showing promising rewards too. </seg>
<seg id=750> This increase in interest by the central bank, however, will surely make many people loudly sing a popular song on the Internet, which is “Uneasy”. </seg>
<seg id=751> Obviously, many people need to reconsider tomorrow’s strategy. </seg>
<seg id=752> Tomorrow’s strategy should focus on stock trading benchmarks. </seg>
<seg id=753> I set the stock trading benchmark at 2,800 points, which is actually just over one point higher than the closing point 2,798.96. But do not disregard this small increase because it will be of pivotal importance to our next stock-trading strategy. </seg>
<seg id=754> If major market indexes goes high and break through the stock trading benchmark, then we may gradually consider locking in part of profits, but we must get some profits first and then set our bar for the next positions according to the closing points. </seg>
<seg id=755> If the market index goes low, I recommend waiting first rather than being in hurry to buy. At a lower price for the market index, our strategy during the whole day is mainly to sell stocks. If the market index moves below the stock trading benchmark, for most of the time in particular, we should be more prudent. </seg>
<seg id=756> We should only consider buy-ins if the market index opens low, goes high, remains stable, and even breaks through the stock trading benchmark. </seg>
<seg id=757> The positioning strategy is complicated and full of many details. Recommend that everyone think carefully according to particulars surrounding the indexes. Tomorrow, the position of market index pressure: 2,805 and 2,835 points; defensive position: 2,765 and 2,735 points; stock trading benchmark: 2,800 points. </seg>
<seg id=758> 3,000 Points Indicate Awakening Moment </seg>
<seg id=759> In early trading, the Shanghai Index remained at low volatility upon opening, indicating that it lacked confidence in rising to 3,000 points. </seg>
<seg id=760> After 10:00, the market index maintained a narrow range of volatility to digest profits. At present, the market operation structure remains sound. As for a technical pattern, the stock index has shown an upward momentum of attack, and the trading volume also supports a market index that is expected to climb. </seg>
<seg id=761> The running trend of the corresponding index is very beneficial to many parties too. </seg>
<seg id=762> According to history, once the index is confirmed to rise, there will be a round of market trends in which the rise will be moderate or large. </seg>
<seg id=763> Now the index is being confirmed. The market will become weak. </seg>
<seg id=764> After the market started to indicate a head and shoulders bottom pattern, the upside resistance level came from the line of downward pressure formed in the past two years, that is, the intersecting line between 3,478 and 3,186 points. This line is also an ascending large symmetrical triangle formed in the past two years, and is close to 3,100 points. </seg>
<seg id=765> From the stock market, after coal and non-nonferrous metal stocks continued to jump, bank and real estate as well as undervalued blue chips took turns to push up, thus raising the valuation of the stock index. </seg>
<seg id=766> Today, real estate stocks were getting stronger and Vanke’s net profits increased greatly, and then stimulated the real estate sector to turn active, whereas the coal domain, which jumped yesterday, showed a noticeable differentiation today. China Shenhua’s stocks opened high and went low; other coal stocks dropped by varying degrees. Meanwhile, many chips were sold and liquidated, reflecting the impatient mindset of floor investors who were holding positions. </seg>
<seg id=767> But when observing that the stock index is strong, we should be aware of some unfavorable factors, for example, bank and real estate stocks are repeatedly troubled by regulation and control. The certainty in the quarterly bulletin of the first quarter and the uncertainty in the future will cause the market to have a greater dispute about the two markets, and will also curb the room in which they have to rise. </seg>
<seg id=768> Although no new currency policy was unveiled last weekend, funds outstanding for foreign exchange have surged and there is an enormous probability of raising the required reserves again this weekend. </seg>
<seg id=769> According to today’s media, the average price of commercial housing in Shanghai dropped below 20,000 Yuan, reaching a new 32-week low,  returning to the same level it was at in July last year. </seg>
<seg id=770> A decline in trading volume due to a housing price game will heavily discount the valuation rise resulting from the attractive first-quarter bulletin for real estate stocks. </seg>
<seg id=771> Following a continuous rise, we should always be cautious and prepare to sell our stocks while allowing our stocks to be held up. Thus, we should sell our stocks in a timely manner to avoid any systematic risk in the event we do not breakthrough! </seg>
<seg id=772> Event Advance Notice: The investment exchange meeting on the theme of “Grand Banquet of Investment Skills and Layout 2011” launched by Sina Finance Club will invite Hufu’s two friends, Liu Dezhong, the chief economist of Minmetals Securities, and Gu Feng, a noted blogger (blog and microblog).

<seg id=773> Can the Market Index Present a Long White Candle Today? </seg>
<seg id=774> Good afternoon everyone. It is anticipated that in today’s early trading the action of killing falls frightened some investors. But this action was actually not true. This blog has analyzed this point before and stated that it is impossible for the market index to fall deeply, picking up will the main trend. </seg>
<seg id=775> Subsequently, led by a batch of themed stocks such as agriculture, water conservancy and computers, the market index started to recover. Of course, the real reason for the rebound in the market index remains to be the resiliency from the financial and real estate stocks. After all, the market index does not rebound if it only depends on themed stocks. Additionally, large-cap shares should remain low. In such a case, naturally, the individual stock plates on the stock market recover across the board, with over 70% of the individual stocks starting to rise out of their declines. </seg>
<seg id=776> After rebounding for five trading days, the early market index deservedly stayed on track during this downward turn. That is, the Shanghai Stock Index should meet repeated liquidation of stocks on the 30-day moving averages. </seg>
<seg id=777> Yesterday, the market index was an upper shadow, where the closing price was lower than the opening price. Today, it staged a rally and recovered. From K-line theory perspective, this is indeed a K-line combination of stopping and stabilizing an index decline although I also think that the current market index still needs some time to </seg>
<seg id=778> be repeatedly shocked before picking up. That being said, I still expect short-term trading to show signs of stopping the decline. Investors should continue to watch. I said before that the market index is no worse and that focus is on individual stocks. </seg>
<seg id=779> Today, this stock market still demonstrated signs of collective recovery. The agriculture stocks rallied again; the individual stocks for computers and industry began to get strong; a top decline in individual stocks in Shenzhen and Shanghai was also below 4%, indicating a strong market trend. </seg>
<seg id=780> Investors are advised to continue to pay attention to the trends of pharmaceutical and agriculture stocks. Recently, the two stocks actively rebounded mainly because they are resistant to inflation along with the fact that full adjustments were implemented early on. Whether this trend continues or not remains to be seen, however. </seg>
<seg id=781> The current situation is individual stocks are active and the market index remains at some of the lowest levels. Investors should still focus their movements on individual stocks. What’s more, they should maneuver into these stocks, but not because these individual stocks meet are bound to rebound after dropping below expected thresholds. </seg>
<seg id=782> Remember, do not think that the sharp falls in individual stocks early on will necessary mean greater probability and dynamics for a rebound because this is completely your personal subjective will. Experience tells me that the Chinese stock market is just a major market where the strong will get stronger and the weak will get weaker. Whether a stock is good or not critically depends on whether it is robust and whether momentum is available to push up it rather than how its superficial trend and performance are. Of course, the major driving momentum is more willing to push up individual stocks supported by performance. This is the standard by which we select stocks. </seg>
<seg id=783> After pushing up in the morning, the market index in the afternoon will likely see a shock rise or a strong shock. Of course, it is still possible that today’s market index will rise moderately or significantly. This can be expected! That’s all for the comments at noon. Good luck to you! </seg>
<seg id=784> Low in Secondary Rise on the Way </seg>
<seg id=785> Disclaimer: The author is not qualified to offer securities investment consultation, and is not engaged in this business! </seg>
<seg id=786> The analysis and research as well as assessment of the market index and individual stocks included in this blog and its live broadcasts is a showing of personal research results and its intended for entertainment purposes only.

<seg id=788> Topic sentence: Low in Secondary Rise on the Way. Given the rising overseas stock market after the holiday, a bad start in the stock market must disappoint many investors. Before the holiday, as the index was near 2,800 points, the author repeatedly emphasized that because this pressure preventing stocks from rising was rather great, investors had better hold on to their cash and have a safe holiday. It turns out that this thinking was correct. </seg>
<seg id=789> Since a pullback has started, how far will this pullback progress? </seg>
<seg id=790> In the author’s opinion, for the Shanghai stock market, first look at the vicinity of 10-day moving averages; for the Shenzhen stock market, look at the vicinity of the 20-day moving averages. In respect to time, adjustment will be the focus of the remaining two trading days this week. Meanwhile, after pullback, the secondary market needs to expand trading volume. In this way, there will be a ladder-like formation between the first pull-up created by energy from trading volume and a second similar type of pull-up. Otherwise, the market will not have a ladder-like trend if the trading volume is not expanded. Thus, there will not be upward pushes in the secondary index market, not to mention that the pressure in the upper concentrated moving average will be broken. Therefore, the momentum created from volume of the secondary pull-up needs to surpass the volume energy on January 27, that is, higher than 110 billion. </seg>
<seg id=791> In respect to sectors, you should settle account by selling purchased shares at a profit level and stay any from individual stocks in high-speed rail and water conservancy, which have repeatedly surged recently. The two sectors are near the end of the push-up. Meanwhile, after pullback, be sure to pay attention to whether a new hot sector will take shape. Only when you switch to a new hot sector will the afternoon market have greater kinetic energy for promoting the index to rise. It is expected that the index will have a new low in the rise near the 10-day moving averages of the SSE Composite Index. The market index will reach the low on Friday at the earliest, next week at the latest. It’s okay only if you wait for it patiently. See the following technical analysis for more. </seg>
<seg id=792> Technical analysis: from the early market, the main force will carry huge momentum to the 2,564 to 2,700 index levels. The index range from 2,661 to 2,800 complies with this expectation. Then, for the secondary backing position of the index, first take a look at the position near the 10-day moving averages, and then at the position near the pre-low of 2,661. The strategy: wait for the index to get back in place. </seg>

<seg id=796> Ghost Child: Live Together, Die Together —“No Regrets” </seg>
<seg id=797> Unless there is an exceptionally good TV series, I seldom watch TV shows, but spend most of my time reading books and watching stocks. </seg>
<seg id=798> Recently, I watched “Stealth General”. In it, beliefs in love and the cause of the Party are conveyed. This really shocked me… </seg>
<seg id=799> I have yet to come across a better show than this one after having watched it. </seg>
<seg id=800> Last week, a client left me a message: Child, I recommend that you watch “No Regrets”. But I did not take it to heart because I had to participate in a live broadcast. </seg>
<seg id=801> But another client also recommended that I watch it. At that time, I thought this TV series appeared to be popular. </seg>
<seg id=802> Unexpectedly, a third client left me a message, which said, “Child, you must watch this film, it is even more moving than the “Stealth General” </seg>
<seg id=803> Within one week three clients recommended that I watch the same film. This had never happened before. </seg>
<seg id=804> Later that night, I didn’t go to the swimming pool; I went to a nearby video shop instead. </seg>
<seg id=805> Usually, I go to video shops just to stroll about. I like wandering throughout the area for horror films and animated films the most. </seg>
<seg id=806> An old man nearing 30 still likes watching animated films. I guess that those reading this blog will die laughing. </seg>
<seg id=807> I cannot help it. Everyone has their own ambition, a, a. </seg>
<seg id=808> When I asked the boss to recommend some good films, he also recommended the same one to me. I was out of excuses… </seg>
<seg id=809> I should watch this film then, since so many people recommended it to me. </seg>
<seg id=810> As a result, this week I was so enthralled by it that I slept badly. My mind raced with storyline. </seg>
<seg id=811> The heroine, Girl No. 9, really moves you. </seg>
<seg id=812> This type of women is probably only really found in the heavens. How it is that she has now come to the world… </seg>
<seg id=813> The ending, in particular, broke my heart, I started to tear up. </seg>
<seg id=814> I am too deep into this play… I let my emotion show in the blog article about the “Stealth General”, which I wrote last time, (you will know what I am talking about if you look for my previous blogs. </seg>
<seg id=815> For this film, however, too many thoughts are beyond expression. Anyway, I can’t put the feelings down in writing. </seg>
<seg id=816> To understand what friendship among friends is, what love for family is, and what really faithful love is… just watch this movie. </seg>

<seg id=1> Again, Bird Hordes Drop Dead, Lying Criss-Cross on Swedish Street </seg>
<seg id=2> While a large number of birds were found dead for unknown reasons in southern United States last week, Swedish officials said up to 100 birds were found dead today, lying on glistening snow in a Swedish street. </seg>
<seg id=3> Disaster rescue worker Christer Olofsson (Christer Olofsson) of the southwestern Swedish town of Falkoeping (Falkoeping) said, in connection of these 50-to-100 jackdaws, that "most of them were already dead." They were birds of the crow family. </seg>
<seg id=4> Ornithologist Anders Wirdheim (Anders Wirdheim) said that this discovery came as a surprise. </seg>
<seg id=5> He told a Swedish tabloid, the "Aftonbladet" (Aftonbladet): "This was extraordinary."  The newspaper put on its website a photograph taken by a reader.  It showed large groups of black birds spread out over most parts of a snow-covered street. </seg>
<seg id=6> Wirdheim said: "They could be jackdaws forming groups in the cold season. Affected by adverse events and circumstances, they were driven by stress to exhaustion and death through wild flights. </seg>
<seg id=7> Olofsson told AFP that police patrols first discovered these birds around midnight and brought five of them back for observation and examination. </seg>
<seg id=8> Olov Andersson (Olov Andersson) of the National Veterinary Institute (National Veterinary Institute) told the Swedish news agency TT that they will do an examination and analysis to find out if the dead birds were infected with bacteria or viruses, including those of a new influenza. </seg>

<seg id=16> Princess Diana's Wedding Cake Sold 30 Years After Wedding </seg>
<seg id=17> A small, dried and shrunk slice of what was claimed to be a wedding cake at the wedding of Prince Charles (Prince Charles) and Princess Diana (Princess Diana) 30 years ago was sold at an online auction in New Zealand at a price of 380 NZ Dollars (USD 290). </seg>
<seg id=18> A woman in Christchurch (Christchurch), New Zealand, named Katrina Greenslade (Katrina Greenslade), sold this slice of cake - associated with the history of a royal dynasty - at an auction on the Trade Me website. She claimed that her family has had it in safekeeping since 1981. </seg>

<seg id=26> Global Unemployment Rate Hits New High, 200 Million Jobless </seg>
<seg id=27> The International Labor Organization warned today that global economic recovery has not been reflected in job openings. Global jobless in 2010 maintained a record level of 205 million. </seg>
<seg id=28> The International Labor Organization said: "In spite of clear signs of economic recovery in a number of countries, official data still show that total global unemployment in 2010 reached 205 million. That is almost as high as that of 2009 and 27.6 million more than that in 2007 on the eve of the world-wide economic crisis. </seg>
<seg id=29> “According to an International Labor Organization forecast, up to 2011, global jobless rate is expected to come to 6.1%, which means 203.3 million persons unemployed." </seg>
<seg id=30> Also according to the International Labor Organization, from 2007 on, industrialized economies and the European Union account for more than half of the global unemployed population; and numerous young people at or above employable age level are still jobless. </seg>
<seg id=31> The International Labor Organization has discovered that in such developing countries as Brazil, Kazakhstan and Thailand, unemployment rates have already dropped down to pre-economic crisis levels. </seg>
<seg id=32> Besides the unemployment problem, “flimsy employment” situations such as temporary employment have plagued some 1.53 billion people. </seg>
<seg id=33> Furthermore, unemployment among young persons also makes people depressed. In 2010, up to 78 million young people were jobless. That is higher than the 73.5 million recorded before the economic crisis began. </seg>

<seg id=49> Shooting Incident in Ohio, USA, One Dead Eleven Wounded </seg>
<seg id=50> Official sources said shooting broke out early morning on the 6th at a fraternity party outside the Youngstown State University (YSU) in northeastern Ohio, USA. One student was killed and 11 persons wounded. </seg>
<seg id=51> A coroner confirmed that the killed YSU student was 25-year-old Jamail Johnson.  According to local media reports, the shooting took place outside the university in the residence of a fraternity member. </seg>
<seg id=52> An investigator of the coroner's office told AFP that bullets hit Johnson's head and lower part of his body; as yet, no suspect has been arrested. </seg>
<seg id=53> A spokesperson of Youngstown's Saint Elizabeth Health Center told AFP that eight of the wounded were released from the center after treatment; and the other three wounded persons remained hospitalized.  But the spokesperson was unable to provide other personal information or to bring their condition up-to-date. </seg>
<seg id=54> After the shooting incident, YSU security personnel were mobilized to strengthen patrol and safety measures.  But, chief security officer John Gocala of YSU pointed out that the university itself was not faced with any threat. </seg>
<seg id=55> Mayor Jay Williams of Youngstown said: "Youngstown police are doing their best to find any clues to the incident.  As mayor of Youngstown, I have profound faith that they will find the information and evidences, as well as successfully arrest and prosecute the culprit in accordance with the law." </seg>
<seg id=56> Naming Russia Mafia State, English Reporter Ousted </seg>
<seg id=57> British newspaper "the Guardian" reported on the 7th that Russian security agencies have unequivocally barred Guardian's Moscow correspondent from entering Russia. </seg>
<seg id=58> Sources at the Guardian said Luke Harding reported on WikiLeaks’ disclosure of the contents of American diplomatic cables. According to these cables, Russia has become a "Mafia state."  The end result of this Guardian report was ouster of the correspondent by Russia. </seg>
<seg id=59> Sources informed of security matters told RIA Novoti, Russia's state news agency, that Harding's full name was put on the persona non grata list    "in compliance with the request made by one of Russia's security agencies that Harding be barred from entering Russian territory." </seg>
<seg id=60> The sources gave no further details, but hinted that the request could have come from the Foreign Intelligence Service (SVR) or from the Federal Security Service (FSB). </seg>
<seg id=61> The Russian Foreign Ministry has not yet made any comment on, or explanation of the action of ordering a journalist out of Russia.  The Guardian, for its part, said that since the end of the cold war, this is believed to be the first time a British newsman is driven out of Russia. </seg>
<seg id=62> Harding stayed in London for two months.  He reported on the contents of the diplomatic cables exchanged within the American foreign service. He flew back to Moscow at the end of last week. </seg>
<seg id=63> According to reports of the Guardian, when Harding was having his passport examined and getting ready to enter Russia, he was denied entry. After being confined in a small room at the airport for 45 minutes, he was put on a scheduled airline flight to return to England. </seg>

<seg id=65> X-Rays Reveal Secret of Faded van Gogh Paintings </seg>
<seg id=66> According to a report published in the United States today, scientists from many countries discovered that chemical reactions caused the bright yellow in paintings by van Gogh to fade and turn brown. </seg>
<seg id=67> Research results published in “Analytical Chemistry” show scientists used high-definition microscopic X-ray beams to find out that sun light caused chemical reactions in varnish and pigments, leading to the fading of yellow pigments. </seg>
<seg id=68> Ella Hendriks of the Van Gogh Museum Amsterdam said: "This kind of advanced research helps us gain deeper understanding of how paintings age and how their colors fade. We should preserve (the results of the research) for future generations." </seg>
<seg id=69> X-ray research carried out at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility in Grenoble, France, also demonstrated that decrease in chromium "is especially evident when chemical compounds containing barium and sulfur exist." </seg>
<seg id=70> Based on research findings, scientists concluded: "The technique of mixing white and yellow pigments that van Gogh employed in his work may have caused the yellow in his paintings to darken." </seg>
<seg id=71> The author of the research report pointed out that the best way to prevent works of art from deteriorating is to avoid exposing them to ultraviolet rays and sunlight. </seg>

<seg id=74> Snow leopard, hare and polar bear have been chosen as mascots of the 2014 Winter Olympic Games which will be held in Sochi on the southern Black Sea coast in southern Russia. </seg>
<seg id=75> The three mascots have been chosen by votes cast by the Russian people. Russia's state television, "Channel One" announced that, out of nine animal candidates, three, namely snow leopard, hare and polar bear, have been chosen to be the Winter Game's mascots. </seg>
<seg id=76> Snow leopard is the top winner who gained 28 percent of all the votes cast. But, Dmitry Chernyshenko, Chairman of the 2014 Sochi Winter Olympic Games Organizing Committee, announced that it was decided that three animals, instead of only the top vote-getter, will be designated official mascots of the Sochi Games. </seg>
<seg id=77> In the meantime, the Sunbeam Boy and the Snowflake Girl were chosen to be mascots of the Paralympic Games. </seg>
<seg id=78> Vladimir Putin, Premier of Russia, said earlier that he would like to have the dazzling and brilliant snow leopard representing the city of Sochi. </seg>
<seg id=79> When he was Russia's President, Putin played an irrefutably important role in the campaign to win the Winter Olympic Games over to a venue in Russia.  Now as Russia's de-facto top leader, Putin commented on the mascot question this way: "The leopard is an animal of strength, power, speed and beauty. It had been an extinct species in the Caucasus region.  But now it is being revived again there." </seg>

<seg id=81> Experts Name Cooling As Key to Prevent Radioactive Release </seg>
<seg id=82> The ScienceDaily website today reported U.S. radiation experts as saying that cooling is the key to prevent disasters from breaking out in the Japanese nuclear power plants damaged by earthquakes. </seg>
<seg id=83> An explosion occurred today in the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant located 250km northwest of Tokyo after its cooling system was damaged by heavy earthquakes.  The explosion gave rise to fears of a core meltdown and radioactive leakages. </seg>
<seg id=84> Ron Chesser, Director of Center of Environmental Radiation Studies at the Texas Tech University, was the first American scientist permitted to enter the restricted nuclear disaster area in Ukraine after the 1992 Chernobyl nuclear disaster broke out in 1992. </seg>
<seg id=85> Chesser told 74the American ScienceDaily website: "If Japan encounters problems in cooling the reactor, that will trigger an emergency." </seg>
<seg id=86> Chesser pointed out that although reports said the reactor of the nuclear power plant has been safely shut down, it still has to be cooled continuously to prevent the core from a meltdown. </seg>
<seg id=87> He said: "Nuclear reactor emergency will be declared when a number of specific trigger points are reached.  One of them is decreasing cooling capability.  Radioactive leakage is another." </seg>
<seg id=88> Chesser said: "Reactors are not like cars, which one can just shut off and walk away from. Reactors will continue to generate a large amount of heat until the cores melt down.  If there is no cooling water, the core may really melt and cause the leakage of massive amounts of radiation." </seg>

<seg id=97> Unrest in Libya   Oil Price in Asia Continues to Increase </seg>
<seg id=98> Analysts say that political turmoil in Libya continues to affect the investment climate on the market, leading to an oil price hike in Asia today. </seg>
<seg id=99> In April, the strike price of a major international crude oil, light crude, traded on the New York futures exchange, was up USD 0.30 to settle at USD 102.63 per barrel. Futures price of Brent North Sea crude for May delivery rose by USD 0.43 to reach USD 115.39 per barrel. </seg>
<seg id=100> Investment analyst Ong Yi Ling of Phillip Futures in Singapore said: "Upward movement of oil price is still supported by the current tension in the Middle East. Investors do not expect Libyan oil to return to the world market in the near future." </seg>
<seg id=101> According to the International Energy Agency, oil-rich Libya, before turmoil flared up there, used to produce 1.69 million barrels of crude a day.  But now the amount has dropped to 400 thousand barrels. </seg>
<seg id=102> The Center for Global Energy Studies in London warns that the current unrest may instill in the market the fear of repeating the drastic 2008 crude price climax of USD 147 per barrel. </seg>
<seg id=103> The Center for Global Energy Studies says the oil market needs "clear and unequivocal instructions" from the "Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries" (OPEC) on how to make up for the shortfall brought about by Libya's plummeting production. </seg>

<seg id=123> In Guizhou, 221 power lines were heavily covered by ice, and 25 circuit breakers tripped because of heavy frozen snow on the power lines. But 19 power lines have resumed normal operation. And workers are sparing no effort in emergency repairs to put the still disrupted six lines back to working order. Not one town or county throughout the province suffered power outages due to icing. </seg>
<seg id=124> Of the Hunan power network, 184 lines were covered by ice. </seg>
<seg id=125> Additionally, nine power lines of the grid in Guangdong, three in Yunnan and 13 in Guangxi were covered by ice.  Thirteen dispatch lines of the Southern Grid Distribution and Control Center were likewise enclosed in ice. </seg>
<seg id=126> Icing was less extreme than the lines were designed to withstand, and has for the present not affected their normal operation. </seg>
<seg id=127> The Central Meteorological Station also predicted that there will be intermittent freezing rain next week, among other regions, in Guizhou, Western and Southern Hunan and Northeastern Guangxi, mainly in the periods between the night of the 5th of January to the 7th, and from the 9th to the 11th. </seg>

<seg id=131> Construction of Kinmen Bridge Begins, Ma Ying-jeou Envisions New Cross-Strait Landmark (Illustration) (2) </seg>
<seg id=132> Bridge Links Greater and Lesser Kinmen </seg>
<seg id=133> According to a report in the "United Daily News" in Taiwan, the groundbreaking ceremony to launch the construction of the Kinmen bridge was held yesterday afternoon. </seg>
<seg id=134> Ma Ying-jeou said building the bridge is not a means to increase the odds of his election; It is a way to restore justice and a fair share of benefits to the citizens in Kinmen. </seg>
<seg id=135> The Kinmen Bridge will become a landmark in the development of cross-strait tourism in the future. </seg>
<seg id=136> "We want to give the people in Xiamen a good reason for taking sightseeing tours in Kinmen.  And we also want to make the people in Kinmen very proud when they extend a hand of welcome to Xiamen tourists." </seg>
<seg id=137> The Kinmen Bridge will link Hu Xia, Jinning Township, Greater Kinmen, to Houtou, Lieyu Township, Lesser Kinmen.  Construction will cost 7.5 billion, and be completed in June, 2016. </seg>
<seg id=138> After completion of the bridge, a drive from Greater Kinmen to Lesser Kinmen will take only five minutes. The completed bridge will immensely improve transportation and medical services in Lesser Kinmen, and even promote tourism in Kinmen. </seg>
<seg id=139> However, Kinmen residents waited nearly 20 years for this five-minute drive. </seg>
<seg id=140> Ma Ying-jeou, Wu Den-yih and Mao Chi-guo attended the groundbreaking ceremony yesterday. </seg>
<seg id=141> Ma Ying-jeou said, in the past, Kinmen bore the burden of many-layered battlefield restrictions under a garrison administration.  Now as cross-strait relations are improving, it is high time that Taiwan should help the outlying island complete its reconstruction and see the realization of the dreams of Kinmen residents. </seg>
<seg id=142> The Kinmen Bridge stands for the hope of the Kinmen people.  It is also a repayment by Taiwan for the favor and service Kinmen has rendered. </seg>
<seg id=143> National Freeway Bureau Director-General Zeng Da-ren said in a briefing, design and construction of the Kinmen Bridge is premised on the objective of "three parts traffic, seven parts tourism."  The bridge is scheduled to be completed in 2016. </seg>

<seg id=149> According to the American daily "World Journal" the court case of Ms Zhao Jing, a scientist of Chinese origin, versus the State University of New York (SUNY), the SUNY Research Foundation and Dr. Olcay Batuman of the SUNY Medical Research Center has already entered its eighth year.  Zhao Jing says she is suffering from depression. </seg>
<seg id=150> A few days ago Zhao Jing rejected the settlement proposed by the other side at a cost of USD 60,000 and retained a new overseas Chinese attorney. </seg>
<seg id=151> The case will be taken up by the Federal Court in Brooklyn on the 10th. </seg>
<seg id=152> Zhao Jing said she has a PhD degree in physiology.  But her former employer, SUNY Downstate Medical Center, hired her at a salary not commensurating with that for PhD degree holders.  The Center first signed a three-year employment contract with her.  Then, it changed the three-year term into an unlimited one, and laid her off after nine months, because, it said, she reported to a human rights committee the "unequal and unfair treatment" she received. </seg>
<seg id=153> She also said that Dr. Olcay Batuman often made her work until two o'clock in the morning, allowed her only five minutes for lunch, disapproved of her going to the restroom, put so much pressure on her at work that she did not have time to go home and had to spend the night in the office, and frequently made fun of the Chinese accent in her English. </seg>
<seg id=154> Hai Ming, the attorney representing Zhao Jing, said he will sue the defendant on charges such as: racial discrimination, breach of contract, retaliatory termination of employment contract, and violation of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act.  He will lay claims to damages of USD 7.5 million and to punitive compensations. </seg>
<seg id=155> Hai Ming said court session on this case will open at the Federal Court in Brooklyn at 9:30 a.m. on the 7th. He estimated that the hearing will last at least five days. </seg>
<seg id=156> The defendant has neither made a comment , nor taken any action in response. </seg>
<seg id=157> World Journal repeatedly tried to contact Dr. Batuman.  An office assistant answered, saying she was out of the office and the time of her return was unknown. </seg>

<seg id=208> Four Queries of "Happiness Index" Survey Cost UK GBP Half Million </seg>
<seg id=209> Chinanews.com (Chinanews online service), February 25 report </seg>
<seg id=210> According to the British newspaper "Daily Telegraph," the Office for National Statistics of the U.K. will send out in April questionnaires to more than 200,000 citizens aged 16 and more in the country on how much they are satisfied with life and how much they are affected by the feeling of anxiety or wellbeing. </seg>
<seg id=211> The study will pay special attention to personal opinion on happiness under such specific headings as married life, friendship and personal health. </seg>
<seg id=212> Sources at the Office for National Statistics said that preliminary budget of this survey will amount to GBP 2 million.  Out of that amount, half a million will go to the survey's first part, namely a 4-question survey for the 200,000 citizens. </seg>
<seg id=213> The Prime Minister is convinced that United Kingdom can do a good job of helping citizens "feel better."  He also said a successful government, while building up the economic power of the nation, should, at the same time, also try to improve the quality of life of the populace. </seg>
<seg id=214> Following this line of thought, United Kingdom created its very first "Happiness Index" immediately after French President Sarkozy made a proposal along the same lines. </seg>
<seg id=215> The questionaire requires the use of a grading range from zero to ten. The following four questions are included: </seg>
<seg id=216> - As a whole, how much are you satisfied with your life at present? </seg>
<seg id=217> - As a whole, how happy were you yesterday? </seg>
<seg id=218> - As a whole, how much anxiety did you experience yesterday? </seg>
<seg id=219> - As a whole, how much value can you find in the contributions you have made? </seg>
<seg id=220> Paul Allin of the Office for National Statistics who is in charge of Happiness Index matters, said: "In principle, we trust the answers given by the people, and will do our research on the basis of these answers. </seg>
<seg id=221> Research staff members said: the optimum valid index should lie between 7 and 8 (in a range from zero to ten), for excessively happy people could be easily "tricked" into "rash" decisions. </seg>

<seg id=287> Xinhua News Agency, January 1 dispatch from Beijing (reporter: Zhou Wei) </seg>
<seg id=288> The "Chinese Folk Literature and Art Association" has just launched a project of digitalizing China's oral literary works. The oral literary works constitute a worthy cultural heritage of the nation and are praised as the "Siku Quanshu" (Complete Library of Four Treasures) of folk kiterature. </seg>
<seg id=289> The project is expected to build the biggest digital library of its kind in China which will house the largest, richest and most variegated collection of folk oral literary works in the country. </seg>
<seg id=290> It is reported that the digitalization project calls for the collection and recording (in digitalized format) of all words, pictures and other information associated with oral folk literary works. And the Chinese Folk Literature and Art Association has mobilized nation-wide  its members and associates in the past 60 years to do the collection and recording work.   These collectors have tapped the records and archives of various regions, from counties (including their subdivisions of cities, districts and Inner Mongolian/Manchurian "Qi" areas) down to townships (and their subdivisions of villages, "Sumo" and streets), throughout the country. They looked for original writing and recordings as well as memorabilia and dived some residents' memories associated with oral folk literary works. The library now houses materils which contain a total of 840 million words. That makes it the largest and most impressive depository of Chinese oral literary works in the country. </seg>
<seg id=291> The project will be carried out in several stages. </seg>
<seg id=292> In the first stage, folk literary works assembled by the Chinese Folk Literature and Art Association will be categorized according to scientific and academic stamdards; and different groups such as fairy tales, legends, narratives, rhymes and songs, epics, long poems, proverbs, riddles (including riddles written on lanterns), "xiehou" type (truncated) riddles and folk music plays will be digitalized for storage in digitalized depositories. </seg>
<seg id=293> Implementation of the project will be concluded before July, 2014. </seg>

<seg id=300> Acting upon the request of a special session of the State Council, the Qinghai provincial government gave top priority to the life and welfare of the Yushu disaster victims sheltered in emergency tents, and granted them, on New Year's Day, more ad hoc heating allowance and more subsidies to compensate for loss to inflation. These cash assistance programs totaling more than 16 million Yuan warmed the hearts of the victims. </seg>
<seg id=301> It is learned that even before the winter of 2010, authorities in Qinghai already paid out heating allowances to the disaster victims in  Yushu. There, at the end of December, ad hoc  subsidies to compensate for inflationary loss were also distributed among the needy. </seg>
<seg id=302> The price subsidy paid this time will be limited to the January to March period in 2011. </seg>
<seg id=303> Twenty thousand households in the Yushu earthquake area which are still accomodated in tents will receive ad hoc heating allowances on the same grounds and conditions of the initial allowance payments soon after the earthquakes. Now, for a total of 90 days, each one of 80 thousand persons is to be be paid a two-Yuan heating allowance each day (or 180 Yuan in 90 days). Total ad hoc heating allowances amount to 14.4 million Yuan. Meanwhile subsidies to compensate for inflationary losses are to be distributed among insufficiently insured households in urban and rural areas of Yushu, farmer families under the so-called "five garantee" insurance schemes, disabled veterans and family members of revolutionary martyrs.

<seg id=313> Xinhua News Agency Wuhan January 13 dispatch (Guo Jiaxuan, correspondent) </seg>
<seg id=314> In Hubei, a major agricultural province in the middle of China, efforts are increased continuously in recent years to conserve its species reserves.  Up to now, over 130 key species of crop wild relatives have been surveyed, collected and conserved, thus establishing a sound foundation to protect the biodiversity and to breed improved varieties of agricultural organisms. </seg>
<seg id=315> Hubei is one of China's regions boasting the greatest biodiversity. </seg>
<seg id=316> Our correspondent learned at the Hubei Agricultural Work Meeting convened on the 13th that in recent years, the provincial government initiated a comprehensive survey in the Three Gorge Dam region, Dabie Mountain District, Mufu Mountain Region, Wuling Mountain District, Shen Nong Jialin Region, these five and other large regions with rich reserves in wild species.  Close to 300 resource distribution areas were located by GPS, and new distribution areas of crop wild relatives, such as the Yichang orange were discovered, as well as new reserves of the valuable species of Chinese gooseberries and wild tea trees. At the same time, 13 crop wild relative natural habitat conservation areas were built, the second highest number of such areas in the country.  Eight rare and valuable species, including wild soybeans, wild lotus, Yichang oranges, wild citrus and wild Chinese gooseberries were put under protection. A crop wild relative ex-situ conservation garden was built, the first of its kind in China's system for agricultural environmental protection. </seg>
<seg id=317> According to the Hubei agricultural, ecological and environmental conservation center, more than 130 key species of crop wild relatives were already surveyed and collected in Hubei. They form rich wild germplasm resources for new agricultural varieties. These crop wild relatives were presented to the Chinese Academy Of Agricultural Sciences and other state-level research institutes. There, experts may apply molecular marking or other processes to locate the genes controlling wild plants' resistance to cold, insects and other adverse influences. Such research work is a sound basis for superior breeding in agriculture. </seg>

<seg id=361> When strong earthquakes, tsunami and radioactive leakage occurred in Japan, the Chinese National Tourism Administration asked travelers to think twice on making a trip there. From the 15th on, large travel agencies specializing in overseas trips, one after the other, have been tapping the contingency budget supplement to arrange for cancellation of booked tours and/or for booking home-bound emergncy flights. </seg>
<seg id=362> Spring time is high season for cherry blossom tourism in Japan. However, a recent earthquake measuring 9.0 on the Richter scale rocked the sea area near Japan and brought up tsunami waves and radioactive leakages. Japanese tourism business was dealt a heavy blow.  Consequently, Ctrip just announced that they will, of their own initiative, persuade tourists - no matter if they are individual  visitors, tourist group members or cruise ship passengers - to cancel their bookings in exchange for full refunds. </seg>
<seg id=363> Some of the plans advanced by the travel agency are: ##those traveling before the end of March are advised to cancel their booking; ## tour packages including departures before April 30 are cancelled and customers are asked to withdraw their booking and receive full refunds; ## tour groups and individual travelers still in Japan will receive refunds based on the number of days they sacrificed. </seg>
<seg id=364> A series of contingency measures were taken to ensure that several hundred ctrip tourists still in Japan will return home safely, either at or before the end of their trips. </seg>
<seg id=365> General Manager Zhang Lei of Beijing UTour International Travel Service Co., Ltd. said in an interview that the cherry blossom time from March to May used to be a peak tourism season in Japan. </seg>
<seg id=366> This year, tickets to view cherry blossoms in Japan sold exceptionally well. In fact, sales volume this year is five times that achieved in the old times. </seg>
<seg id=367> "Recent earthquakes really brought heavy losses to cross-border tourism business, to the airlines and travel agencies." </seg>
<seg id=368> Beijing UTour company has started its contingency program and is  helping more than 1,000 tourists cancel or change their group tours. Those who cancelled their tours were already given a full refund. </seg>
<seg id=369> All losses, including fees paid for visa application, were shouldered by the UTour company and the tourists who had suffered the loss were fully compensated. </seg>

<seg id=394> China Announced Last Year's Top Ten Criminal Cases of Cigarette Counterfeiting and Selling Fake Cigarettes </seg>
<seg id=395> Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, March 29 (Reporter: Zou Wei) </seg>
<seg id=396> Reporter learned from The Ministry of Public Security that in 2010, under the joint command of the Security Bureau of the Ministry of Public Security and the Monopoly Division of the State Tobacco Monopoly Bureau, local public security authorities and tobacco sectors in close cooperation and working side by side, using “routing the lairs, breaking the sources, cutting off the network, and catching the culprit" as the main line, continued to intensify the crackdown.

<seg id=402> Sky-high Kindergarten Tuition </seg>
<seg id=403> < Click & copy this posting's address and recommand it to a friend > </seg>
<seg id=404> The Nanhu Art Kindergarten is located beside the Nanhu Recreation Park. The beautiful scenery surrounding the institution, together with its high-end facilities attracted many parents, who bring their children along on a tour here. The parking lot is full of cars of famous brand, such as BMW, Mercedes Benz and Land Rover. </seg>
<seg id=405> However, the annual tuition fee of 60,000 Yuan is a heavy burden to carry. One year's kindergarten tuition equals that for ten years of university education. </seg>
<seg id=406> But what’s so special about this kindergarten? </seg>
<seg id=407> 1. Kang Zheng, Executive Board Chairman of Guangzhou Foreign Economic Professional and Technical College, who is the top-man in charge of the Nanhu Art Kinergarden, said, the kindergarten features foreign languages and the arts and undertakes to educate and raise future leaders. </seg>
<seg id=408> Director General Ye Xiaoju said that the managing director of this kindergarten is an American; 70% of its teachers are foreigners, coming from the United States, Great Britain, the United Arab Emirates and many other countries. </seg>
<seg id=409> All child-care workers here, including those doing laundry,cooking and cleaning work are  from the Philippines who speak a foreign language. </seg>
<seg id=410> Every month, the school will hold such events as “Culture Week,” focusing on the culture of various world countries. </seg>
<seg id=411> "We will raise children who not only retain their Chinese cultural roots but are also blessed by their knowledge of and connections with the life and culture of a foreign country." </seg>
<seg id=412> When the children attend this school, they have a guarantee to go to elementary schools in Singapore, accompanied by their parents during their schooling abroad. </seg>
<seg id=413> Accommodated inside a two-story building of the “American Dream Villas,” the kindergarten has a usable floor area totaling around 2,000 square meters. </seg>
<seg id=414> 70% of the teachers, as well as the cooks and the cleaning personnel are foreigners. </seg>
<seg id=415> 2. Upon graduation, the children must attain the "six threes"-level, that is, they should be able to hold a 30-minute conversation with a unaquainted foreigner, play three tunes, make three pieces of pottery, perform three dances, sing three songs, and paint three pictures. </seg>
<seg id=416> 3. Each year, a child has a fixed number of these lessons: 80 in piano, 40 in drawing, painting and dancing, and another 20 in pottery making. </seg>
<seg id=417> The kindergarten has two managing directors, one a Chinese and the other, a foreign national. Each class is assigned three teachers, and taught by an additional six American or European teachers, thus nurturing the little darlings in a climate of "two cultures, three languages." </seg>
<seg id=418> In everyday life, nutritionists plan daily menus, and a child-care worker monitors and records the meals 24 hours a day. </seg>
<seg id=419> 4. The kindergarten is like a children's recreation park. It is built in the style of a Disney World castle, and colorful leisure time equipment is spread all over the place. </seg>
<seg id=420> Besides large outdoor play areas, the "Lovely Little Farm", a library, a piano room, the kindergarten also boasts a pottery and a dancing room and functional areas, down to rock-climbing grounds, a golf course and a temperature-controlled swimming pool. </seg>
<seg id=421> Many parents cried out in astonishment at the sight of such a "luxurious outfit." </seg>
<seg id=422> On dozens of video monitors installed all over the kindergarten, parents can keep an eye on how their children live and learn. </seg>
<seg id=423> The interior is sumptuously decorated, beds cost RMB1,800 each, all furniture are of famous brands. </seg>
<seg id=424> This kindergarten installed a fingerprint identification system. Only when the system accepts a fingerprint as identical to those registered in the program can one leave the school with his children. </seg>
<seg id=425> It might not be wrong when a few people live the lives of aristocrats first. But the common people in rural areas should be able to have their own kindergartens, since their children are too young to commute by public transportation. </seg>
<seg id=426> When reconstructing our villages, why can't we even build kindergartens, but have to travel to the cities? It is as if people are forced to move to the cities and buy property in order to take care of their children going to school there.  Who is harmed by our educational system? </seg>
<seg id=427> [Social Kaleidoscope] Discussion of Genuinely Happy Marriages </seg>
<seg id=428> Discussion of Genuinely Happy Marriages <Click & copy the address of this posting and recommend it to a friend> </seg>
<seg id=429> Happiness is something everyone desires. </seg>
<seg id=430> To most people, happiness in their marriages is of great significance. </seg>
<seg id=431> However, genuinely happy marriages are not built on superficial aspects. </seg>
<seg id=432> In all the TV and movie dramas emerging in China today, girls are flattered as noble princesses and depicted as materialistic "gold-worshippers". </seg>
<seg id=433> Is this the only way all these film directors know how to improve their ratings? Are they only capable of following the crowd and copying each other's themes and styles? </seg>
<seg id=434> At any rate, under the influence of such TV and movie dramas, the characters of too many Chinese girls are insidiously distorted. </seg>
<seg id=435> Many girls take it for granted that they can beat or scold their boyfriends or husbands at random. </seg>
<seg id=436> They believe that husbands should serve them unconditionally. They hold the wrong value that only men who do not spare any costs to please them really love them. </seg>
<seg id=437> One has to admit that some men nowadays are also under the sway of this general trend and have become slaves to women. </seg>
<seg id=438> Most men, however, can no longer bear this kind of suffering, and abandon their girl friends or wives. </seg>
<seg id=439> This is also the main reason for the dramatic rise in the number of divorces in China today. </seg>
<seg id=440> Many romantic couples separate who should have suited each other well. </seg>
<seg id=441> Many married couples get divorced who would have lived together in affection. </seg>
<seg id=442> This is very tragic. </seg>
<seg id=443> Many girls today, however, are still so naive to believe that only those men really love them who unconditionally forgive their errors and condone their headstrong and undisciplined ways. These women will eventually come to a tragic end. </seg>
<seg id=444> We should bear in mind that real felicity and happiness is not built upon others' sufferings. </seg>
<seg id=445> Men are born equal. No one has the right to oppress anyone else. </seg>
<seg id=446> Even the most even-tempered will not be oppressed unconditionally by anyone. </seg>
<seg id=447> The human emotion is like a spring. The more pressure it sustains, the more violently will it rebound. </seg>
<seg id=448> Do unto others as you would have them do unto you. </seg>
<seg id=449> If one really loves you, he will have no qualms about pointing out to you your shortcomings and mistakes. </seg>
<seg id=450> If he does not recognize your mistakes, then he does not really love you. </seg>
<seg id=451> He is only fooling and dallying with you. If a girl spends all her time only in search of a man who coaxes her every day, then she would probably not gain real happiness. </seg>
<seg id=452> We live in a materialistic society, in which most people only pursue transient pleasures. The vulgarity, both in speech and behavior, of men and women has become all too commonplace. </seg>
<seg id=453> Many men consider girls only instruments of sexual relief and childbearing. They rely on deceiving girls in order to gain their own ends, which is what really matters to them. But it is for this very reason that girls gradually lose faith in love. </seg>
<seg id=454> These men consider many superficial things as substantial, such as material status and the ability to mislead girls. </seg>
<seg id=455> Marx once said, a marriage without love is prostitution in disguise. </seg>
<seg id=456> But most marriages in China are probably built upon materialistic foundations. </seg>
<seg id=457> This is also why so many older men have become as much in demand as sweet buns. </seg>
<seg id=458> Older men have material means to offer, and know how to flatter girls. </seg>
<seg id=459> People gradually lose sight of the real meaning of love. Real love is not based on deception. One is loved not for her beauty or good figure. </seg>
<seg id=460> Real love is founded on mutual attraction, respect and support, as well as care for one another. </seg>
<seg id=461> Real harmony in marriage is based on common sacrifice by both men and women. </seg>
<seg id=462> Regardless how the roles are distributed (husbands take care of external matters and wives the household, or both come up for the needs of livelihood), as long as marriages are based on harmony and genuine love, they will endure as long as the universe, and contribute to happiness in the lives of married couples. </seg>
<seg id=463> VOA Plans to Discontinue Chinese Broadcasts and TV Programs </seg>
<seg id=464> VOA Plans to Discontinue Chinese Broadcasts and TV Programs </seg>
<seg id=465> Website of Deutsch Welle, February 15 dispatch </seg>
<seg id=466> Original Title: Voice of America to Discontinue Chinese Language Broadcasts and TV Programs </seg>
<seg id=467> Vopice of America will discontinue its Mandarin and Cantonese Broadcasts and TV programs, but keep its Chinese language website. It will also lay off its work force on a large scale. </seg>
<seg id=468> On February 14th, the Broadcasting Board of Governors submitted to Congress its budget request for fiscal year 2012, which specified the above retrenchment measures. </seg>
<seg id=469> The budget request stated that Voice of America plans to discontinue all shortwave and FM, AM broadcasts in Mandarin, satellite TV programs and all Cantonese language broadcasts.  And it also plans to lay off 45 workers, including 38 in the Mandarin Programs Group. </seg>
<seg id=470> This Group currently has a work force of 69 persons. </seg>
<seg id=471> The broadcastering Board of  Governors submitted the above-mentioned budget request after President Obama announced the federal budget plan for fiscal year 2012. </seg>
<seg id=472> Founded in 1942, VOA ranks among the best known and most prominent Chinese language broadcasters in the world. As a part of the Federal Government system of the United States, VOA operates under the supervision of the Broadcasting Board of Governors. </seg>
<seg id=473> The decisions (embodied in the Broadcasting Board of Governors' budget request) herald the end of a historic era. </seg>
<seg id=474> Use of Public Transport and Bicycles as Criteria for Judging Leadership </seg>
<seg id=475> Government cars used by offcials have become an ailment of society. </seg>
<seg id=476> Not only do officially-owned vehicles cause traffic congestion, but some of their passengers also often make a show of their power, thus. inciting resentment among the common people and throwing society into disarray. </seg>
<seg id=477> Actually, in most cases, government vehicles are not needed. Leading cadres should set a good example by riding bicycles or taking public transport to work. </seg>
<seg id=478> Not only that, we should make use of bicycles or publictransport by officials a general criterion to assess the quality of our leaders. </seg>
<seg id=479> In developed countries in the West, local government officials using public transport or riding the bicycle is nothing new. </seg>
<seg id=480> For example, former Governor of Massachusetts and Democratic presidential nominee Dukakis took the Boston subway to work. </seg>
<seg id=481> Bloomberg, former Mayor of New York City, also used to ride on public transportation. </seg>
<seg id=482> Today, in London's efforts to reduce traffic jams, its mayor sets an example and rides his bicycle to work. </seg>
<seg id=483> Why can't our leaders and cadres do the same? </seg>
<seg id=484> Beijing has 700 thousand government vehicles. </seg>
<seg id=485> If at the rate of one car per cadre, the number of cars assigned to the cadres would be 700,000, more than Boston's total population. </seg>
<seg id=486> Too many officials! </seg>
<seg id=487> So many officials ride government cars, alienating themselves from real life conditions. Not only are they ignoring the people's suffering, they are also causing serious traffic congestions. </seg>
<seg id=488> Government cars isolate the cadres from the people. In principle, they should be abolished. </seg>
<seg id=489> Just think, what will happen if riding public transportation or the bicycle is to become a criteria to judge cadres? </seg>
<seg id=490> This method of assessment can be considered an effective means to create harmony in society and correct our one-sided pursuit and exhortation of GDP-growth. </seg>
<seg id=491> If a leader runs his land in such a way as to generate overall discontent and stir up public indignation, he or she would not dare ride in a public means of transportation or bicycle around in the streets. </seg>
<seg id=492> It is because in the city he governs, public order is basically maintained, and residents live and work in peace and contentment, that the Mayor of London can leisurely ride down the streets on his bicycle. </seg>
<seg id=493> If a cadre cannot even venture out in the streets or take public transportation in the region of his governance, who gave him his claim to the government post? </seg>
<seg id=494> In history, places where government officials can walk about freely in the streets were invariably those blessed with sound governance and a modern and well-developed social and political environment. </seg>
<seg id=495> Examples are Middle Age autonomous cities and city states in Europe. These places are the origins of capitalism and enjoyed the greatest economic and cultural progress. </seg>
<seg id=496> In the streets of Florence, Venice, Bruges and Amsterdam, government officials and city residents interact daily as closely as fish and water, at least in the golden ages of these cities. </seg>
<seg id=497> This is also an important reason why city residents trusted the government. </seg>
<seg id=498> Everyone knows that when an official constantly swims against the historical tide, he or she will not even be able to survive in such an environment. </seg>
<seg id=499> As a matter of fact, this tight inter-dependency makes government officials hesitant to disrupt their relationship to the people. </seg>
<seg id=500> This is a good way to prevent corruption. </seg>
<seg id=501> Harmony in society is not a matter of paying lip service, one has to act upon it. </seg>
<seg id=502> What is to be done? </seg>
<seg id=503> Cadres should use public transportation and ride the bicycle, they should form close ties to the common people. </seg>
<seg id=504> This first step should be taken before one can consider amd/or about anything else. </seg>
<seg id=505> If leadership cadres cannot even co-exist in harmony with common people in everyday life, how can there be harmony in our society? </seg>
<seg id=506> Japanese Oldsters' Greatest Happiness on New Year </seg>
<seg id=507> Many Chinese tourists to Japan told me, "Old people inJapan are so industrious! They either drive taxis, clean hotel rooms, or work as guards in commercial buildings. They all look very old, and it's hard to tell if they are any good on the job. At any rate, they look like they work hard every day!" </seg>
<seg id=508> Indeed, the type of oldsters walking their birds every morning or training their voice in the park in Beijing are rarely seen in Tokyo. </seg>
<seg id=509> Not to mention Chinese seniors who like to practice their Taichi early in the morning. That is pure luxury in the eyes of the Japanese elderly! </seg>
<seg id=510> Most of them stay away from such leisurely pastimes. </seg>
<seg id=511> According to Japanese law, all men and women above the age of 75 may continue to drive, but are encouraged to apply, voluntarily, a sticker showing a read leaf. </seg>
<seg id=512> Called a "red leaf" if one wants to make the name sound better, the symbol is, from a gloomy viewpoint, also interpreted as a "falling leaf," in analogy to the impending death of the oldsters. What pessimism! </seg>
<seg id=513> Statistics show that twice as many old people over 75 as a decade ago were the cause of traffic accidents last year, and also, less than 35% of the cars driven by the elderly carry the "red leaf"-symbol. In order to improve traffic control, the National Police Agency of Japan decided, as of June 2008, to impose on old drivers a compulsory "red leaf"-sticker. Offenders of the new regulation will be fined. </seg>
<seg id=514> Who would have expected this? The solidarity among Japan's elderly were strong. They vehemently opposed making a big deal out of the "falling leaf". To them, this measure represented a great offence to a society which upholds respect to the elders, and will under no circumstances be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id=515> So by Christmas time, the Japanese police agency finally changed their minds and rescinded the mandatory use of the "red leaf"-symbol, retreating to the position of voluntary application. </seg>
<seg id=516> One Japanese senior said, "We don't have to stick on the symbol! How wonderful! This is my greatest happiness this year!" </seg>
<seg id=517> Having said this, the oldster suddenly accelerated his car, which roared off as if it is flying. </seg>
<seg id=518> The figure below shows the "falling leaf"-symbol on old people's cars. </seg>
<seg id=519> Actually, if it hadn't been for the suicide of AV queen Ai Iijima - the news came on Christmas Eve in that year - the topic of senior drivers not under obligation to apply the "falling leaf"-sticker would have taken a prominent place in the Japanese media. Be as it is, it could not compare with the curiosity and shock felt by the populace towards the self-destruction of a beautiful lady. Even later, Japanese society didn't seem to be very interested on the happiness of old people, at least, as one perceives it. </seg>
<seg id=520> In comparison, Ai Iijima, whose body was not discovered until a week afterwards, remained at the center of attention. Her website, set up in the time when she was alive, is still bursting with crowds of surfers. Condolences fly thickly like snowflakes in the comments section. </seg>

<seg id=523> Look at these Beautiful Girls of Nepalese Entertainment Troupe (Fig.) </seg>
<seg id=524> The Chinese Army has its singing troupes, such as those of the Air Force, Naval and General Political Departments. At regional levels, each large military region has its own entertainment troupes: the Frontline (Troupe) of the Shenyang (Military Region), the Advance Guard of Jinan, the Frontline of Nanjing, the Vanguard of Fuzhou, the Battle Comrade of Beijing, the Warrior of Guangzhou, the War Flag of Chengdu, and the Spearhead of the Lanzhou military area. </seg>
<seg id=525> It is said that Chairman Mao agreed to all these names. That's why they have been used ever since. </seg>
<seg id=526> The author of this blog, Qin Quanyao, lived in Dengshikou in Beijing's eastern district. The High School No. 25 where he was a student had its east gate directly facing the entertainment troupe of the Air Force Political Department. </seg>
<seg id=527> Wow, those troupe girls were really pretty. They walked around like water lilies swaying in the wind. Everyone thought they are a grand sight in the streets. </seg>
<seg id=528> Fantastic! </seg>
<seg id=529> Old Qin once sang a song with its lyrics changed to: "The east is red, the sun is rising, the airforce political department brings forth Chinese beauties." </seg>
<seg id=530> Wherever the entertainment group is! Yepii!! People are enjoying life to their heart's content!!! </seg>
<seg id=531> The Nepalese communist party has a Maoist armed forces. They also set up a Chinese-style entertainment troupe. </seg>
<seg id=532> Whenever a political organization holds a summing-up meeting, an oath-taking rally, or a citation meeting, the last item but one on the program is always a performance by the entertainment troupe. </seg>
<seg id=533> Content of the performance is of course praise of the political organizations and their leader, praise Prachanda as the red sun. </seg>
<seg id=534> Prachanda holds much in store for performances of the entertainment troupe. He frequently gives personal advise and guidance before the performance, and greets them onstage afterwards. </seg>
<seg id=535> Under such a condition, how can the entertainers not have tears in their eyes? </seg>
<seg id=536> Like in China, the members of the female entertainment troupe are particularly good-looking. </seg>
<seg id=537> They come from all over Nepal to perform songs and dancing with a distinct national flavor which, of course, must highlight the Sherpa girl legend which are also in Tibetan folklore. </seg>
<seg id=538> Performances proceed in an atmosphere of good order, and all guards and ushers wear a badge showing Prachanda‘s head. </seg>
<seg id=539> Migrant Workers in Zunyi Rail Station: Search for Their Kidnapped Children </seg>
<seg id=540> They are farm hands from nearby counties or cities presently taking up temporary jobs here.  Their children have been abducted by child-trafficking gangs within the past 12 months, leaving the parents not a single clue to their whereabouts. </seg>
<seg id=541> But these parents are determined in their unwavering search for their children. "Even if this is the only one thing I do in my life, I will pursue it ceaselessly until the kid is found or until I draw my last breath," sounded a representative voice. </seg>
<seg id=542> It is hoped that everyone of us will extend them a hand, that the criminals will be caught soon, and the separated families will be reunited as early as possible. </seg>

<seg id=545> Zhou Yafu and Son of "Gongchen" in China's Political History </seg>
<seg id=546> Governance of traditional political systems in Chinese history generally evolves through five stages, namely - governance by "Gongchen" (key regime-founding officials); by their sons; by virtuous and capable officials; by insidious and selfish officials and by obsequious traitors. </seg>
<seg id=547> The evolution is also depicted by the following epigram: "Benevolence of the perfect gentleman, like a towering tree, is felled in five generations." </seg>
<seg id=548> Of these five stages, the second stage, governance by sons of the founding fathers, had a prominent example in the early years of West Han Dynasty. </seg>
<seg id=549> Zhou Yafu was one of the best known representatives of these sons (or "princelings."). </seg>
<seg id=550> While the father struggled in sweat and blood to help the sovereign found a new dynasty, the son was often not by his side.  (Cases of feudalistic dynasties established by China's minorities of Manchus and Mongolians were the exceptions.) </seg>
<seg id=551> But, life and career of the younger generation followed exactly the path of their elders who were busily engaged in some nation-building assignments. </seg>
<seg id=552> And life in these years gave the princelings much useful and extraordinary experience and insight. </seg>
<seg id=553> Zhou Pu (Zhou Yafu's father) led the Imperial Palace Guards and fought against all odds to crush the rebellion of the Lv family.  But his son, well rested and fully prepared, crushed the exhausted Qixiong (Seven Warlords) forces rather easily from a vantage point. History shows that events just do not happen by chance. </seg>
<seg id=554> And for both the father and the son, what happened at the end did not happen by chance either. </seg>
<seg id=555> In traditional feudalistic times, leadership of the "Gongchen" was inevitably followed by the control exercised by their princelings.  Generally speaking, the succession could not be stopped or bypassed. </seg>
<seg id=556> Therefore, one should not be surprised. As the proverb goes, "Refuse to be shocked by something monstrous and the monster will evaporate of its own accord." </seg>
<seg id=557> However, the sons of the pioneers were still rated one grade below their fathers. </seg>
<seg id=558> For the experience and background of these two generations, after all, were distinctly different. </seg>
<seg id=559> They did acquire something good and useful from their fathers, but other strengths, virtues and experiences of the elders were denied them. </seg>
<seg id=560> After all, the son was born in a world of wealth and comfort. His understanding of and feeling for life-or-death struggles acquired through his father's narratives were indirect and superficial. </seg>
<seg id=561> Hence, their lectures on overcoming hardships were merely a run-of-the-mill show of little substance. </seg>
<seg id=562> Zhu Zhanji, Emperor Xuan of the Ming Dynasty, joined his father Zhu Di in several military expeditions to the north.  But he remained a man who would not even take a bite when invited to the dining table of an ordinary citizen. </seg>
<seg id=563> (Even his mother, the Empress Dowager, took a few bites.  But for Zhu Zhanji, nothing at all.) </seg>
<seg id=564> That is the difference. </seg>
<seg id=565> Zhou Pu was put in prison because the old Emperor was jealous and suspicious. But Zhou Pu himself was free from such vice as arrogance and lack of civility. </seg>
<seg id=566> On the other hand, Zhou Yafu did not see a clear breach of etiquette, - demanding a pair of chopsticks directly from Emperor Jin of Han Dynasty - as out-of-line behavior. </seg>
<seg id=567> Even though, for the son of a "Gongchen," it could, in fact, be something normal. </seg>
<seg id=568> For them, haughtiness is a deep-rooted attitude that often emerges irresistibly into the open. </seg>
<seg id=569> It should be pointed out that sons of key regime-founding officials were indeed blessed with outstanding insights and capabilities. But they could also make serious blunders. </seg>
<seg id=570> Then, how can such blunders be prevented? </seg>
<seg id=571> The answer is: Establishing and developing a political system of democracy - a day dream in a feudalistic age. </seg>
<seg id=572> Democracy cannot prevent political blunders and disasters altogether. But it could forestall very serious ones, or, at the least, find a way to minimize damages and salvage what is left behind. </seg>
<seg id=573> However, this is an entirely different theme to dwell upon here. </seg>
<seg id=574> Comrade Jiang Qing </seg>
<seg id=575> On January 25, 1981, a Special Tribunal of the People's Supreme Court passed sentences on ten major criminals of the anti-revolutionary gang led by Lin Biao and Jiang Qing. </seg>
<seg id=576> Jiang Qing and Zhang Chunqiao were both given a death sentence suspended for two years.  They were deprived of all political and civil rights for life. </seg>
<seg id=577> Wang Hongwen was sentenced to life imprisonment and deprived of political and civil rights for life. </seg>
<seg id=578> Seven were sentenced to a definite period of time:  Yao Wenyuan - 20 years; Chen Boda - 18 years; Huang Yongsheng - 18 years; Wu Faxian - 17 years; Li Zuopeng - 18 years, Qiu Huizuo 16 years;  Jiang Tengjiao 18 years.  They were deprived of all political and civil rights for 5 years each. </seg>
<seg id=579> Reader's guide: Why Do We Question Shanghai Jiaotong University's Appointment of Luc Montagnier? </seg>
<seg id=580> According to a report in the "People's Daily" of November 22 last year, Luc Montagnier (sometimes also written out in Chinese with one additional added at the end. See article in "Wikipedia") accepted an invitation to lecture at Shanghai Jiaotong University. This report aroused much attention, because precedents of Chinese universities appointing Nobel Prize winners to a full-time professor's position are very rare. </seg>
<seg id=581> News picture of Montagnier receiving the Nobel Prize </seg>
<seg id=582> However, what looked like good news has met with much skepticism and even downright denunciation in the Chinese academic world and among commentators. The reason for the criticism is that Montagnier, who made important contributions to Aids research, seems to have erred from the right path.  His clinical trials on autism, considered by some as "non-mainstream test methods" (see article in "Nature"), and his obsession with the so-called molecular homeopathic treatment are all objects of much dispute and often rejected in the scientific research community. To his colleagues, Montagnier's work even contains pseudoscientific elements. </seg>
<seg id=583> "Science" magazine then interviewed Montagnier exclusively (reprinted by Jiaotong University's article "When You Drink Water, Think of its Source"). The interview was published under the insinuating title "French Nobelist Escapes 'Intellectual Terror' to Pursue Radical Ideas in China." </seg>
<seg id=584> Even though the interview did not touch on all open issues, it apparently did contain many questions raised by "Science" editors at an academic level. But Montagnier's answers did not help to refute or resolve these doubts. He gave only the impression of a "wide open space to exercise your imagination." </seg>
<seg id=585> Already now, discussions have become as detailed as an examination of the research experiments used for Montagnier's dissertations. Hence, we feel we have to go one step further than just raising voices of doubt. We should conduct an in-depth examination of this matter, not least because the Chinese media and public are confused about Montagnier as a person. We aim to build with a solid foundation for our viewpoints on "What is exactly the subject matter of Montagnier's research?" and "What to make of his research?" </seg>
<seg id=586> Therefore, what began as private conversations among several fellow squirrels of the Science Squirrels Club became a methodical process in which Montagnier's most recent three dissertations were repeatedly read through and discussed, until finally, out of them, new questions were distilled. Together, we used these questions as a basis to produce two "evaluations of dissertations": "The Immorality of Physics without Detailed Examinations", and "The Amazing Biology Which does not Recognize the Origin of DNA." From viewpoints of different scientific disciplines, these treatises deal with the flaws in Montagnier's experiments and theories. Today and tomorrow, they will be released to the large interested public as an aid to pass judgment on this matter. </seg>

<seg id=588> "Most Awesome Planners' Dialog" in History by Hai Mo and He Xuelin </seg>
<seg id=589> "Most Awesome Planners' Dialog" in History by Hai Mo and He Xuelin </seg>
<seg id=590> Hai Mo, prominent poet, author and planner met Mr. Xuelin - who won world fame by returning Shi Yuzhu to glory and success - for a "3-day-and-night super dialog" in the Caizhi International Mansion in Beijing from 6th to 8th in March, 2011. </seg>
<seg id=591> The dialog made an all-embracing review and analysis of Mr. He Xuelin's 20-year career of putting his plans into practice. The two joined hands to carry out an innovative and constructive dialog which thoroughly explored a series of leading-edge issues connected to major aspects of China's planning industry - including its current development and future prospects, as well as its opportunities and challenges. </seg>
<seg id=592> This "Hai-He Dialog" has been branded "history's most awesome verbal exchange among planners."  For it did set new precedents and break all records in being a meticulous, "leave-no-stone-unturned," search, in its use of sharp and deep-penetrating language, and in smashing all "air-time duration" records. </seg>
<seg id=593> What's the topic of discussion that made Hai Mo so serious and gruff? </seg>
<seg id=594> Hai Mo and Mr. He Xuelin are engaged in a dialog on current developments and future prospects of the planning industry in China. </seg>
<seg id=595> My Savage Family Little Fatty Mafia-style Education </seg>
<seg id=596> When Little Fatty takes his meals, I teach him to "eat more. Then you don't need to be afraid of fights and brawls when you grow up!" </seg>
<seg id=597> Uh-huh! </seg>
<seg id=598> He waves his little fists at me. </seg>
<seg id=599> When Little Fatty washes his face, I instruct him to "wash your face until it glows, so that you can pick up girls like Gu Debai, yeah!" </seg>
<seg id=600> He looks at me, bleary-eyed. </seg>
<seg id=601> Whenever I want him to share his food with me, I would tell him: "We live in a community, so we should go through thick and thin together, bear the same burden and eat the same food." </seg>
<seg id=602> When a married woman is our guest at home, I quickly cover up Little Fatty's fawning face. </seg>
<seg id=603> Hold on a second, remember not to hit it off with "Elder Sister"... </seg>
<seg id=604> What are we crossing over? </seg>
<seg id=605> Activities abound lately in Beijing's blogosphere, but without much influence and effects. </seg>
<seg id=606> Mostly, people with all kinds of backgrounds are brought together in an inter-disciplinary forum to shoot off their mouths. There is neither substantial content nor cultural depth. </seg>
<seg id=607> We live in a typical time of "15 minutes of fame", as described by Andy Warhol. Of course, Warhol's personal fame would last longer than 15 minutes. </seg>
<seg id=608> Words should not bring the same pleasure as sex, because that's not words are here for. </seg>
<seg id=609> Words are an expression of human civilization, setting Man apart from other animals. </seg>
<seg id=610> Those who write too many microblogs use words far too indiscriminately. </seg>
<seg id=611> In this age, which boundaries did we actually cross? </seg>
<seg id=612> Coming out of the movie "I am Number Four," I wondered: "Will there be a sequel?" </seg>
<seg id=613> As a kid, when I saw a movie, my mind was always busy conjuring possible follow-ups to its conclusion. Later on, I gradually realized that authors, script writers and directors intentionally kept the ends ambiguous ... </seg>
<seg id=614> In "I am Number Four", we see aliens arriving on planet Earth. No motives were given. Why did they come to protect the Earth? No answer.  Only a hot pursuit by killers.  Just like in Chinese martial arts stories in which old scores are settled and old grievances redressed... </seg>
<seg id=615> In "I am Number Four", we have everything, from No. 3's murder in the wild, the involvement of the Internet, space legends, high-tech weapons, wrestling in American schools, forged documents... </seg>
<seg id=616> Assaults on No. 4's life become the movie's main theme, just as in "Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows", the main focus is on protecting Harry Potter... </seg>
<seg id=617> In "I am Number Four," No. 4 is protected by many patron saints, like in legends. Anyway, in "I am Number Four", we already realize that there is a higher mission at stake, like "Player Kill" in a super computer game... </seg>
<seg id=618> Watching "I am Number Four" is an adequate weekend-pastime, even though not as gratifying as big blockbusters. The fighting is already similar to that in Chinese martial arts chivalry. If you say Chinese movies concentrate on Kung Fu, American movies, for their part, stress the merging of high-tech into the fighting scenes... </seg>
<seg id=619> "I am Number Four" does not have a final conclusion, just like Harry Potter 7.1. The saga will be continued... </seg>
<seg id=620> Time to Raise the Stakes in Cell Phone Gaming </seg>
<seg id=621> By Zhang Shule: Tan Qunzhao, CEO of Shanda Games Ltd., said that Shanda Games will concentrate its forces on the mobile Internet platform, setting the opening of its next move beyond the PC. </seg>
<seg id=622> However, up to now, almost all first-rate online game companies only had some ideas in this general direction, but have not come up with any results. When a baked cake, that is, the online gaming industry, still tastes good, no one is really putting real efforts into mobile Internet games. </seg>
<seg id=623> As a whole, the online gaming business is in a good position to tap the mobile Internet market. But companies are still just toying with the idea of taking this action. </seg>
<seg id=624> In reality, for the past couple of years, the online gaming industry has already expressed the wish to develop its strategy in mobile Internet. The reason why intentions have not been converted to a growing line of business lies mainly in the lack of a converging point. Due to various restrictions such as types of cell phones, surf speed and other factors, online gaming has not actually been integrated into the many features of mobile phones. </seg>
<seg id=625> Still, the industry has not formed any concept on developing this wide-open, promising market. </seg>
<seg id=626> In my opinion, this convergence point will be browser games, which in 2011 will bring together online gaming and mobile Internet, accessing the Internet via ipads, E-books, notebooks, cell phones and other mobile devices. </seg>
<seg id=627> Moreover, if well-delineated groups of customers are targeted with precision when the enterpreur enters this market, more profits could be gained, no matter whether revenues are generated solely from advertising instead of from the gamers, or from fees charged for playing. </seg>
<seg id=628> On-line gaming companies are lagging behind video websites which have already entered the fray with their browser games. </seg>
<seg id=629> Video websites are moving into online games because they hope to attract users to browser games and become profitable in a market where video games are costly and customers have deep pockets.  Instead of taking advertisement from others, video websites can carry ads of their own, as overall development costs of browser games are not high. </seg>
<seg id=630> Besides video websites, all platforms with large numbers of visitors will give browser games a try. </seg>
<seg id=631> At present, there is already a few examples of success in browser games, such as PPS video on demand. Video websites entered this market at precisely the right time. </seg>
<seg id=632> As a whole, 2011 looks very bright for the online game industry. </seg>
<seg id=633> Sales in online games did not go down because users do not play games anymore. It is because online game companies are beginning to take R&D seriously. So, the industry will certainly make a come-back. </seg>
<seg id=634> This article is a revised version of the interview IT Commercial News website had with me. Differing opinions are welcome. </seg>
<seg id=635> Are today's children even more unhappy? </seg>
<seg id=636> Yesterday, I read a British report on "High-quality Childhood", which came to the conclusion that today's children are less happy than before. </seg>
<seg id=637> The reasons are, first, a higher divorce rate, and second, more working mothers nowadays. </seg>
<seg id=638> If these two reasons are really so significant, how can our kids go on living? How many of our mothers are willing to give up their work for their children? </seg>
<seg id=639> Imperial Residence in Pushkin - French Style Gardens </seg>
<seg id=640> Pushkin is a small town 24 km in the southern suburb of St. Petersburg and was formerly where the imperial estates were located. </seg>
<seg id=641> Actually, this area includes two parts: Alexander Park and Catharine Park. </seg>
<seg id=642> Nowadays, tourists concentrate on Catharine Palace and the surrounding park areas. </seg>
<seg id=643> The Catharine Park is roughly divided into two parts according to their different styles: </seg>
<seg id=644> One part is a French garden at the front and back of the castle; </seg>
<seg id=645> the other is an English landscape park centering on a lake southwest of the castle. </seg>
<seg id=646> The French garden is mainly characterized by its meticulous, neat and orderly layout, mostly in symmetrical design. It features a variety of elements, such as the lawn in front of the palace, ponds, alleys and decorations of statuary. </seg>
<seg id=647> The plants in the park are carefully chosen and arranged in pattern designs. Even the trees, shrubbery and flowers are all neatly trimmed in straight and clear-cut shapes, as if all garden inhabitants are lining up at attention and demonstrating their allegiance to the imperial family. </seg>
<seg id=648> Viewed from the windows of Catherine Palace, an iron-wrought gate outside, together with the statue of a graceful flutist, create a picture of complete symmetry. Melodious flute music flows through the pure and tranquil air of the garden the whole year around. </seg>
<seg id=649> the Cameron Gallery is a colonnade for people of that time to stroll along while enjoying the scenery. A building in an austere Greco-roman style, it is also a good example of European classical architecture. </seg>
<seg id=650> Construction work started in 1779. After completion, the structure was named after its architect Cameron. </seg>
<seg id=651> Architect Charles Cameron was a Scotsman. </seg>
<seg id=652> His work, both simple and well-balanced in style, subdued and harmonious in color, and delicate and refined in decorative elements, won whole-hearted approval from the Empress. </seg>
<seg id=653> The Cameron Gallery follows the gently rolling terrain of the imperial residence. The whole building is bright and spacious. The spiral staircase at the front is decorated on both sides by beautiful and unique copies of bronze statues depicting the ancient Greek and Roman deities Flora (goddess of flowers) and Hercules (demigod commanding superhuman strength). </seg>
<seg id=654> At the pond, there are rental booths for period costumes. Put them on and be catapulted back into the 18th century; stroll along the clear pond, its shores dotted with statue after statue, and breath in the rich, classical atmosphere. </seg>
<seg id=655> The neatly and symmetrically arranged alleys are bordered by erect hibiscus trees found all over Russia. Their wood, pliant and light, is used for nestle dolls and other handicraft objects. </seg>
<seg id=656> In the park, vegetation of varying heights thrive, lilacs arranged in neat patterns are in full bloom. The same species of trees become bigger when grown in Russia! </seg>
<seg id=657> Great Britain Employee Paraded Publicly for Stealing 845 Pounds of Company Money; Boss Fined 13,000 Pounds for Insulting Him </seg>
<seg id=658> The picture shows an Englishman named Mark Gilbert who is paraded on the street with a sign hung around his neck. The person grasping him by the arm is his former employer Simon Cremer. </seg>
<seg id=659> In October 2008, Cremer discovered that his employee wrote a company check, cashed it and put the cash in his pocket. The furious employer tied up the employee, hang a sign on him showing "Thief - I stole 845 pounds and am now on my way to the police," and then paraded him publicly in the streets. </seg>
<seg id=660> In the end, the employee who stole the money admitted his wrongdoing at the police station. After receiving a rebuke and warning, he was immediately released. </seg>
<seg id=661> But the angry boss was sued for illegally detaining the employee. Several court sessions later, he had to agree to an out-of-court settlement and pay GBP 5,000 damages and another 8,000 Pounds in lawsuit expenses. </seg>
<seg id=662> Still fuming when interviewed by the "Daily Telegraph," this employer, who runs a flooring company, said: "This is really disgusting. He stole money from me, then turned around and sued me. After what he did, I didn't want to give him a single cent. I'm really sick of this. He is the thief, but I still have to pay him damages. This is really making me furious." </seg>
<seg id=663> On the other hand, floor layer Mark Gilbert, who was paraded in the streets, said he originally wanted to take the lawsuit to the highest court and claim higher compensation for psychological injury, but he does not have that much money for the appeals. So he had to accept the out-of-court settlement of GBP 5,000. </seg>
<seg id=664> According to him, he did not write and cash the company check out of greed. He did it to "help" the excessively busy employer, who was far behind in paying the employee his salary,which he needed urgently for the holiday season. </seg>
<seg id=665> He moved out of town soon after the incident. </seg>
<seg id=666> Hong Kong Always Dated at McDonald's - Might as Well Hold a "McWedding" </seg>
<seg id=667> Hong Kong residents organizing a wedding feast now have one more choice, a "McWedding". </seg>
<seg id=668> McDonald's Hong Kong introduced its wedding costume in 2011, and recently, the first couple chose to hold this new and curious wedding at a fast food restaurant. </seg>
<seg id=669> On Valentine's Day in 2011, a McDonald's near Hong Kong's financial district decorated its entire restaurant with pink balloons. Amidst them, a "cake" is made from a pyramid of baked apple pies and a pile of crystal commemorative rings bearing the letter "M" were put on top. </seg>
<seg id=670> Friends and relatives, holding McDonald's drinks and fast food, blessed Kelvin and Ashley, who got engaged in a unique ceremony. </seg>
<seg id=671> They are the first future marriage couples to be welcomed by McDonald's Hong Kong after the restaurant introduced the wedding package. McDonald's is confident about this pioneering event because they think it would satisfy the needs of young Hong Kongers who like to date at McDonald's and for whom traditional wedding venues are too expensive. </seg>
<seg id=672> Shirley Chang, in charge of McDonald's Hong Kong, said in an interview: "They meet here (McDonald's), their love thrives here, so they will also choose to have their big day here." </seg>
<seg id=673> A basic McDonald's "Warm and Sweet Wedding Package" sells at 9,999 Hong Kong dollars. It includes McDonald's menus for about twelve people, wedding gifts, invitations printed with the McDonald's logo, a yellow "M", and decorations for the venue. </seg>
<seg id=674> At a small additional cost, wedding couples can also rent balloon wedding gowns, corsages and cakes made of balloons, huge pink McDonald's backdrops and other decorations. </seg>
<seg id=675> Compared to a wedding banquet at a conventional Hong Kong restaurant, this price level is indeed very attractive. However, couples who dated at McDonald's are aware that their elders will definitely have a hard time accepting this type of ceremony, so they can probably only throw their engagement parties there. It would probably be a bit difficult to use the fast food restaurant as a wedding venue. </seg>
<seg id=676> U.S.A. Pregnant Women to Enjoy Privilege - Around-the-Clock Free Parking All over New York </seg>
<seg id=677> Pregnant women in New York are lucky. The city government is debating a law allowing all pregnant women park without paying, anywhere in New York, any time. </seg>
<seg id=678> The bill was proposed by Councilman David Greenfield. Once it is passed, future mothers need only show the traffic authorities a doctor's proof of their pregnancy and apply for a sticker. Then, they will be able to park, legally, in every corner of New York City, even in "No Parking" zones. </seg>
<seg id=679> And nowhere do they need to pay for parking either. </seg>
<seg id=680> This privilege will extend to one month after their due dates (to make sure those women who have not given birth on their due date can still enjoy it). </seg>
<seg id=681> Mr. Greenfield proposed this bill because his own wife had a lot of problems parking both times when she was pregnant. </seg>
<seg id=682> New York is well-known for difficult parking. There are too many people and too few parking places.  And parking fees are very high. </seg>
<seg id=683> Even though all parking lots have zones "reserved for would-be mothers", a space is still hard to find sometimes. </seg>
<seg id=684> Therefore, Greenfield believes that the government should pass this measure to ensure parking for every pregnant woman anywhere. </seg>
<seg id=685> Similar laws were put into effect in the states of Georgia and Oklahoma a long time ago, but not yet in New York. </seg>
<seg id=686> New Yorkers do not unanimously support this bill, though. Not a few people expressed their opposition on the website of New York Times. </seg>
<seg id=687> Some think this is sexual bias. Pregnancy is not a handicap and does not need differential treatment. </seg>
<seg id=688> If they can drive, why should pregnant women enjoy privileges not even granted the disabled? </seg>
<seg id=689> Parking space is a very valuable resource in New York, and cannot be given to pregnant women just like that. </seg>
<seg id=690> Others say if the government wants to take care of pregnant women, they might as well pay for their taxis. </seg>
<seg id=691> If it is hard for pregnant women to drive anyway, why not give them money to take taxis? This way, the parking problem is solved, and taxi drivers can help the women carry their bags and other loads. </seg>
<seg id=692> Actually, this matter reminds me of the big discussion earlier in China about "seats shouldn't be given up to seniors (pregnant women) during rush hours." </seg>
<seg id=693> At that time, some Internet comments were: "If old people are retired, why should they jostle with office workers?" Others said: "Women shouldn't become pregnant if they can't afford taxis." </seg>
<seg id=694> Basically, both are the same issue, granting pregnant women the privilege of free parking in America, and giving up seats to them in China. Do people feel that this kind of special treatment is necessary? </seg>
<seg id=695> I watched the film "Don Quixote" and cried. </seg>
<seg id=696> To comment on a movie shown in October last year is indeed a bit too late. But very few Chinese movies find their way into foreign movie theaters. Even "Let the Bullets Fly" cannot fly like its bulletsit to Singapore, let along this movie. </seg>
<seg id=697> I saw this film aboard a Singapore Airline flight to Japan. This 3D-film itself was lousy to the core. Its producer seemed to be learning how to make 3D movies instead of applying his talents to creative movie  making. </seg>
<seg id=698> Besides, some of its scenes are of such poor taste that the film is further and further removed from the standards of a classical masterpiece. </seg>
<seg id=699> All these shortcomings, however, do not outweigh the success of the script, and the glory of human nature exhibited in the character of Don Quixote. </seg>
<seg id=700> Toward the end of the movie, when Don Quixote uttered his fervent and passionate declaration, tears even gushed out of my eyes like a fountain. </seg>
<seg id=701> Ever since I watched this movie, Don Quixote became the hero I worshipped most. Although a fictional figure, his almost maniac pursuit of his dreams moved me deeply. </seg>
<seg id=702> Ever since antiquity, the majority of people tried to support similar standards. When a person acted independently and pursued his dreams, he would be called impractical, even insane. </seg>
<seg id=703> I think it is because I have had a similar experience that I cried. I seldom complain, since society does not sympathize with the fallen. All I can do is continue exerting my efforts and proving myself while holding on to my dreams. Do you realize how hard this is? </seg>
<seg id=704> The tentative title of my second book is "In 80 Days around the World"; the subtitle is, as of now, "Don't Buy Houses, Buy Dreams." I just wanted to tell everyone how gratifying it is to pursue one's dreams. </seg>
<seg id=705> Just like what Stephen Chow said, "If you don't have dreams, you're no better than dead." </seg>
<seg id=706> So, what are your dreams? What about your childhood dreams? </seg>
<seg id=707> What are you doing today? </seg>
<seg id=708> In Adam Sandler's movie "Mr. Deeds", the same question is raised. </seg>
<seg id=709> It is no wonder I like Chow's and Adam's movies. </seg>
<seg id=710> Today, this question also came from Guo Tao. And what is your answer? </seg>
<seg id=711> At the end of the film, Sanchez even battled the windmill. This is even more impressive than the original work. </seg>
<seg id=712> Let us pursue our dreams, even though we will make a few mistakes along the way. </seg>

<seg id=714> Warehouse Entry Management System </seg>
<seg id=715> 1. Upon delivery of purchased goods (including purchased raw materials and machine or spare parts), the person in charge at the supply department draws up, in four copies, a material inspection and acceptance list. </seg>
<seg id=716> (The warehouse keeper signs the material inspection and acceptance list (or the rukulian) and sends one copy to the supply department for filing, one to the inspection department; one to the material control department for them to forward to the finance department; and one copy to the warehouse where it serves as basis for issuing the "warehouse receipt or rukudan.") </seg>
<seg id=717> The warehouse keeper compares each of the goods to description, specification, quantity and unit price in the material inspection and acceptance list. If all the goods pass his inspection, he signs the material inspection and acceptance list. </seg>
<seg id=718> The warehouse keeper issues a receipt of stock in three copies containing the actual results obtained by checking each of the goods. The delivery man compares the goods to the receipt of stock together with the warehouse keeper, making sure that everything is correct. By signing the warehouse receipt of stock, he ensures that all data pertaining to the physical goods correspond to those on the lists. </seg>
<seg id=719> When all procedures for issuing the material inspection and acceptance are completed, the warehouse keeper, using the copy of the material inspection and acceptance list designated for warehouse entry, and a stub of the receipt of stock, records the actual goods stored in the warehouse. Of this record, one copy is handed over to the finance department, and the other to the supply department. </seg>
<seg id=720> 2. When goods manufactured by the company itself are received into the warehouse, the quality control department must issue a quality certificate for the product and send it by special dispatch to the warehouse keeper. </seg>
<seg id=721> The warehouse keeper issues a warehouse receipt of stock in three copies according to the status of the goods he receives. </seg>
<seg id=722> Both sides compare the products to the receipt of stock list and sign the list. </seg>
<seg id=723> Of the signed warehouse receipt of stock, one copy each serves as bases for recording the goods actually stocked in the warehouse, for collecting statistics on the workshop production, and for cost accounting and accounting of goods of own manufacture by the finance department. </seg>
<seg id=724> 3. Purchased goods which are sent directly to production as required by production processes should go through both goods receipt and goods issue procedures so that the company's material flow is accurately reflected. </seg>
<seg id=725> 4. When excess materials are returned to the warehouse from the workshop, three copies of a material requisition form in red letters are completed. Detailed explanations have to be given in the comments section. </seg>
<seg id=726> When processing an end-of-the month goods return, a material requisition should be drawn up at the same time for the following month. </seg>
<seg id=727> 5. When inconsistency in quantity, quality, specification,or type is found in goods which are inspected for receipt into the warehouse, the warehouse keeper has the right to reject the goods and make reports to the supply and production departments and to the company's management, depending on the procedures involved. </seg>
<seg id=728> Stock Market Sectors to Lead a March toward 3,000-Point Height </seg>
<seg id=729> Yesterday, market indices moved slightly lower to a pseudo-positive close. </seg>
<seg id=730> The Shenzhen and Shanghai stock markets saw a total capital outflow of 9.502 billion Yuan, consisting of 1.695 billion Yuan from institutional investors and 7.807 billion Yuan from retail investors. </seg>
<seg id=731> After a low opening, the market at first lifted itself up slightly, but then suddenly moved south several times after 10:15 a.m. At some points, it even touched levels below the average of the 5th and the 10th. </seg>
<seg id=732> However, after touching the 2.897 point mark - that is the line linking the 5th and 10th values - the market was supported from below and began to rise at 2:15 p.m. until reaching a pseudo-positive close. </seg>
<seg id=733> Ideal outcome today would be a grade-A positive close. </seg>
<seg id=734> Should the market close lower, there will be troubles ahead in the short-run. </seg>
<seg id=735> But, no matter what comes to pass, the market will have to go upward when the 3,000-point position is reached. </seg>
<seg id=736> Yesterday, the hot points shifted rather swiftly. During the morning session, biological and medical shares were buoyant.  This sector, as we discussed several times before, usually is very active when the market bounces and plunges wildly. Journals showed on the 10th that pharmaceutical shares of Guangzhou firms hit the ceiling on the 10th. So did shares of Fengyuan Pharmaceuticals Inc. </seg>
<seg id=737> Meanwhile, the article we published yesterday before stock market opening reported that in the real estate sector, shares of some companies jumped up sharply because of the new policy announcement on supportive measures behind the soft housing market. </seg>
<seg id=738> We still firmly stand behind our view yesterday that to reach the 3,000-point height, real estate, financial (banking, stock brokers and insurance) and non-ferrous metals sectors must lead the way. </seg>
<seg id=739> Playing Stock Market after Central Bank Raises Interest Rate </seg>
<seg id=740> The People's Bank of China has decided to raise benchmark interest rates for Yuan (RMB) accounts kept by financial institutions with the People's Bank, starting on February 9, 2011. </seg>
<seg id=741> For one-year deposits, the raise will be 0.25%. </seg>
<seg id=742> We are aware that the purpose of raising interest rates is not to directly impact the stock market but to ease inflationary pressures.. </seg>
<seg id=743> In fact, the central bank has made clear its basic policy ever since announcing an increase of reserve requirements for the first time earlier this year. Presently, policy measures such as further upward adjustments of reserve requirements, and raising interest rates, are in the cards. An upward trend is here. </seg>
<seg id=744> Therefore, it would be a joke to say, an increase of interest rates indicates the end of a weak and downward market. </seg>
<seg id=745> It is now increasingly complicated and tricky to venture into the stock market.  Many rules and theories of the past cannot be applied under today's conditions.  For many policies not designed to impact the securities market of yesterday are now increasingly affecting it. And playing the stock market index futures will be more difficult than ever. </seg>
<seg id=746> Since the very beginning of 2011, securites market transactions each and every day must have convinced all participants that nothing there is easy. </seg>
<seg id=747> Therefore, every one must exercise caution and not satisfied with merely putting faith in the out-dated indices. </seg>
<seg id=748> During the lunar New Year's season, stock markets in the United states are moving upward one after another. And many a trader here are expecting a windfall. </seg>
<seg id=749> Even major players are gettng ready with half of their "red envelopes." </seg>
<seg id=750> But, this central bank action of increasing interest rates would drive all of them to the mood best expressed in this popular song on the internet: "Taan Teh (My Heart, Up and Down)." </seg>
<seg id=751> Apparently, many people must review their plans and tactics for tomorrow, if they wish to stay on. </seg>
<seg id=752> To play the market tomorrow, it is imperative that one pays close attention to where the benchmark is. </seg>
<seg id=753> I myself set it at 2,800 points which is only a little more than 1 point higher than where the market closed yesterday.  But don't take this one point slightly, it will directly impact the way we play the market today. </seg>
<seg id=754> If the market opened higher, we can consider, step-by-step, how to realize the corresponding profit and make sure that goes into our pocket.  Then, we could find a stock position to start our work the next day on the basis of today's close. </seg>
<seg id=755> If the market opened low, I would suggest that we should first wait and see, instead of rushing in with purchasing orders.  For the whole trading day, we ought to lower our stock position, especially when the market loiters below the benchmark level, </seg>
<seg id=756> except when the market as a whole moves steadily upward after a lower opening, or even reach above the benchmark level.  Only if that happens, could we start consider placing some orders. </seg>
<seg id=757> A strategy based on one's stock position is highly complicated and fully loaded with vital details.  I suggest that one must examine it carefully based on a detailed study of the market. Tomorrow, on our market here, the pressure position is set at 2,805 and 2,835 points; the defense position, 2,765 and 2,735 points and market benchmark position, 2,800 points. </seg>
<seg id=758> It's 3,000 Points, Time to Wake up </seg>
<seg id=759> Morning session of the Shanghai Securities Exchange opened low and unsteady today, indicating little confidence that market indices could reach 3,000 points. </seg>
<seg id=760> After 10 a.m. fluctuations of the Shanghai securities composite index within a narrow range began to improve conditions and sentiments in the market. With higher turnover pushing the whole market upward, technical analysis shows the composite index is poised to strike out in the same direction. </seg>
<seg id=761> Corresponding index movement trends prove to be highly optimistic. </seg>
<seg id=762> Experiences show that an effective upward movement, once confirmed, will bring out a good, or even superlative positive trend in the market. </seg>
<seg id=763> However, as the process of confirmation is still going on, market conditions and sentiments remain relatively frail. </seg>
<seg id=764> A graphic presentation of the market trend exhibits a "head and shoulders" pattern.  Here, upper resistance level is formed by the resistance line of the past two years which is a line connecting point 3478 and point 3486, or the upper resistance line (currently located near point 3100) of a large symmetrical triangle over the last two years. </seg>
<seg id=765> Following the hectic rally in coal and non-ferrous metals, several market sectors such as banking, and realties followed suit. Certain blue chips valued below par also joined the climb one after the other. Together they increased the estimated value of major stock indices. </seg>
<seg id=766> Today, the real estate sector, energized by tremendous net profit of China Yanke was going strong.  But the coal sector which rose sharply yesterday, became visibly disintegrated today. China Shenhua opened high but then slid downward. Other coal shares sank at various rates. At the same time, many sold their shares for cash and left, indicating the restlessness of shareholders in attendance. </seg>
<seg id=767> Having sensed the strength of the market, we should also have taken notice of its weakness and misfortunes.  For example, banking and real estate have often been placed in the straitjacket of controls and restructuring requirements. And they have become more controversial because quarterly reports paint them in definitive outlines but future perspectives give out an uncertain picture. Such controversy curtails the potential for growth. </seg>
<seg id=768> Although a new monetary policy was not announced last week. But volume of hot money (in the form of foreign exchange) inflow increased so rapidly that another upward adjustment of bank reserves ratio has also become imminent. </seg>
<seg id=769> Media reports said today average price for commercial housing units in Shanghai has dropped below the 20,000 Yuan mark to reach a record low in 32 weeks. That is a return to the level of July last year. </seg>
<seg id=770> Playing the realty market could depress the total turnover of the sector. Consequently, the euphoria following an attractive quarterly report of the real estate sector would evaporate and expectations drastically slashed. </seg>
<seg id=771> We must be constantly on the alert after a period of uninterrupted buoyancy.  While holding considerable quanyity of shares in expectation of a market rise, we must concurrently prepare ourselves for a large downward adjustment of that position. As soon as we see that a desirable breakthrough is ruled out altogether, timely action must be taken to reduce holdings and to forestall systematic risks. </seg>
<seg id=772> Forthcoming events: The "2011 Banquet on Investment: Overview and Techniques" sponsored by the Sina Financial and Economic Affairs Club will feature two specialists of the Hufu Group: Chief Economist Liu Dezhong of Minmetals Securities Co., Ltd. and well-known blogger Gufeng (Weibo Blog).  The two will go very deep in exchanging views with the audience, and share their "battlefield experiences" and up-to-date discoveries in the marketplace, without any reservation.  Friends and fellow bloggers are invited to give them close attention and support. </seg>
<seg id=773> Will Stock Market Follow Durable Positive Course Today? </seg>
<seg id=774> Good Day! The downward push in the market this morning which probably scared some investors. However, it certainly does not represent the reality. This blogger here did dwell on this matter hours earlier. It is impossible that the composite index will plunge to a great depth. A rebound is expected to be the general trend. </seg>
<seg id=775> Led by farm crops, water conservation, information technology and similar specialized "thematic" shares, the market as a whole will begin to warm up again. Of course, the main force behind an all-embracing rebound comes from the staying power of the broad financial and real estate sectors. After all, without the ground-level support of these major sectors, only the so-called thematic shares cannot possibly bring about a full-scale market recovery. Now, under present circumstances, practically all market sectors are warming up and more than 70% of individual shares have begun to go in the right direction. </seg>
<seg id=776> After a rebound lasting five businessdays, naturally, the market as a whole stays near the upper edge of the present downturn to "reshuffle its cards" along the average line attained in the Shanghai Exchange on the 30th. </seg>
<seg id=777> Stock market index hit the ceiling yesterday, but today a slide has been reversed and lost territory recovered. Theoretically, a K-line combination in a stabilized market has been established, even though the composite index will need more time to stage a real rebound after experiencing a series of violent turbulences. </seg>
<seg id=778> However, I also earnestly look for signs of short-term recoveries and urge all investors to do the same. Basically, I have said: the composite index will not deteriorate further, and our attention should be directed mainly to shares of individual issuers. </seg>
<seg id=779> Today, signs still point to a collective return to the warmer days on the market. Agriculture shares took off again, and computers and individual industrial companies began to show increased strength. Weakening shares on the Shanghai and Shenzhen Exchanges limited their fall within 4%.  Signs characterizing a strong market emerged clearly on the horizon. </seg>
<seg id=780> We suggest that investors continue to keep an eye on the trends of medical and agricultural shares. They were very active in the two-day recovery phase mainly because they are anti-inflationary fighters themselves, and because previous readjustment work was carried out in full measure.  (Though, how long its effect will last remains to be seen.) </seg>
<seg id=781> At present, shares of individual companies are active; major client groups are supporting the market as a whole; investors should pay attention to individual share issuers and avoid jumping into excessively depressed shares during their recovery period. </seg>
<seg id=782> Please take this point to heart: Do not presume that the deeper a share had sunk, the greater will be the probability and power of its recovery. Such talk is only an expression of one's subjective wishful thinking. Experience tells us that stock markets in China are markets of their major investor groups where the strong always stay strong and the weak, invariably weak. To judge if a stock is good or bad, the criteria  are not market trends or even performance of the issuer company. The key point lies in the powerful major investor groups, or more precisely, their presence in the market and their interest in the shares in question.  But, on the other hand, their inclinations are affected by the good performance of the issuer company itself. That explains how and why we select a given stock traded on the market. </seg>
<seg id=783> After an upward pull of the composite index this morning, the trend in the afternoon tends to be a strong but unsteady upward surge. But, a long and strong positive course is not ruled out, or is even expected. Now our mid-day commentaries are coming to a close. We wish you the best of luck. </seg>
<seg id=784> Low Point of Second Wave to Emerge Right Here </seg>
<seg id=785> Notice: This blogger is not qualified as a securities investment consultant and is not engaged in such consulting services. </seg>
<seg id=786> This blogger's direct broadcasts containing analyses on the market as a whole and/or on individual shares result from studies for his/her own benefit and enjoyment. They should not be taken as guidelines or advices for the public. </seg>
<seg id=787> This blogger's comments on individual shares and related matters concerning technical capabilities, flow of funds or stock pools are not recommendations to the public, but are the results and foundation blocks of his own research work. </seg>
<seg id=788> Let's go right back to our main theme. The low points on two recent upswings were set against the background of a steady climb on forein stock makets. The end of the short-term recovery at market opening after the year's holiday season must have disapplinted many.  The sinking trend just after the market opening must have disappointed many.  When the market index was around 2,800 points before the holiday season, this writer repeatedly emphasized that, if downward pressures are not removed, investors should hold on to their shares through a worry-free holiday season. He was proven right. </seg>
<seg id=789> Now, we have entered a recovery phase, where will it carry us? </seg>
<seg id=790> In the Shanghai Exchange, I think, investors should first study the moving average on the 10th in Shanghai; and in Shenzhen, they should do the same on the 20th.  In the remaining two business days of the week, the stock market will go through needed adjustments and corrections.  Meanwhile, after a recovery phase, trading volume must be expanded so that the new wave could reach a height comparable to that attained when the first wave climaxed. (Here, "comparable" means close enough to form an easy "step-up" or "step-down" relationship insterad of being widely separated.) Otherwise, there is no sense talking about a second wave or even about breaking through the downward pressure of the moving average.  The increase in trading volume behind a second wave in the market should push the index above its January 27 level of 110 billion Yuan. </seg>
<seg id=791> With regard to different market sectors, one should, as soon as possible, get rid of or/and avoid touching shares of the high speed rails and water conservatory sectors which shot up repeatedly in the recent past but are tapering off at present. (As to the market as a whole,) investors must do their best to find out if new "hot point" market sectors will emerge, for these sectors will provide greater momentum to push market index upward in the future. It is expected that the floor of a new wave will be formed near 10PMA of the Shanghai stockmarket. And the time would be Friday at the earliest, or some time next week. Please wait for it patiently. For a technical analysis, please read the passages below. </seg>
<seg id=792> Technical analysis: - Our last article predicted that remarkable changes will take place in the 2564-to-2700 range. The current upswing of market index from 2,661 to 2,800 is in line with the prediction.  The second wave is initially expected to reach a height near 10PMA, and later to reach the neiboring area of the earlier low point of 2,661. Market strategy: - Wait patiently for a recovery. </seg>

<seg id=796> Youling Gongzi: The "Lofty Sentiment" of "In Life as in Death, We Will Stay Together." </seg>
<seg id=797> I seldom watch TV series, preferring to read or monitor the stock market most of the time. I only watch exceptionally outstanding TV dramas. </seg>
<seg id=798> Lately, I saw "The Invisible General" and was shaken up quite a bit by the faith in love and in the Party... </seg>
<seg id=799> For a long time after that, I didn't come across any better series... </seg>
<seg id=800> Last week, one client left a message for me: "Gongzi, I suggest you see "Heroine of Lofty Sentiments." I was about to do a live broadcasting, so I ignored him. </seg>
<seg id=801> And then, another client suggested me to see it. At that time, I thought that the TV series must be a hit. </seg>
<seg id=802> Then, a third client left a message to me, saying: "Gongzi, here's one you just have to see. It's even better than 'The Invisible General,' even more moving..." </seg>
<seg id=803> Three bloggers recommending the same film to me in the same week. This has never happened before. </seg>
<seg id=804> So, in the evening, instead of going swimming, I visited a nearby audiovisual store to buy the DVD. </seg>
<seg id=805> When I go to a DVD store, I usually wander around aimlessly, preferring the horror and animation sections. </seg>
<seg id=806> As an old man approaching thirty, I still like animation films... I reckon readers of this blog will have a good laugh at me. </seg>
<seg id=807> I can't help it. Each to his own devices, haha! </seg>
<seg id=808> When asked which films he would recommend, the store owner actually named this one.  What can I say? </seg>
<seg id=809> When so many people suggest me to watch this film, I might as well do it. </seg>
<seg id=810> So, I lived through this week as in a dream, sleeping badly, my head full of scenes from the film. </seg>
<seg id=811> I'm so deeply moved by the main character, Miss Jiu. </seg>
<seg id=812> A woman like her exists only in heaven. How often will she appear before us mortals? </seg>
<seg id=813> Especially the final ending. It broke my heart. My eyes swam in tears. </seg>
<seg id=814> This is submerging myself too deeply in the story... Last time, when I blogged about "The Invisible General," (please see my past blog), I wrote about my thoughts and impressions after seeing the film. </seg>
<seg id=815> But this film stirred me up so much that I can't put one line down in writing. It's as if I don't have any impressions to write about. </seg>
<seg id=816> If you want to see what love between friends is about, between relatives, or what really makes faithful love, go see this film. </seg>
