<seg id=71>Well, eight hundred dollars for a week's cruise isn't quite luxurious enough, if you'll excuse my saying so. But if you can be satisfied with a lower deck cabin, with no sea-view on a smaller boat, there are a couple of possibilities for you.</seg>
<seg id=72>It's on the fourth floor.</seg>
<seg id=73>We can't eat it all, so we'd like to take it home.</seg>

<seg id=118>For six nights.</seg>

<seg id=412>Pardon?</seg>
<seg id=413>Bourbon and water, please.</seg>
<seg id=414>Excuse me. Would you take a picture of us?</seg>
<seg id=415>Which would you prefer, tea or coffee?</seg>
<seg id=416>I'll give you a lift to the airport.</seg>
<seg id=417>You bet.</seg>
<seg id=418>Can I have a roll of black and white film?</seg>
<seg id=419>Do you have something a little more plain in this style?</seg>
<seg id=420>Can I use this card here?</seg>
<seg id=421>I left my passport in the taxi.</seg>
<seg id=422>Please speak slowly.</seg>
<seg id=423>I'll take this on board.</seg>
<seg id=424>I'd like something to eat.</seg>
<seg id=425>This food is really good.</seg>
<seg id=426>My chest throbs.</seg>
<seg id=427>Who wrote the script?</seg>
<seg id=428>I'd like a compact car.</seg>
<seg id=429>The flight has been delayed one hour.</seg>
<seg id=430>Not much.</seg>
<seg id=431>How long does it take to have them reissued?</seg>
<seg id=432>How would you like your meat?</seg>
<seg id=433>Okay. But we're fully booked until next Monday.</seg>
<seg id=434>Medium, please.</seg>

<seg id=446>I want to see an opera tonight.</seg>
<seg id=447>I would like a spacious room, please.</seg>

<seg id=451>I'll give you a shot.</seg>
<seg id=452>I need more plates to share.</seg>
<seg id=453>Thief.</seg>
<seg id=454>Is there a ticket agency around here?</seg>
<seg id=455>No milk, please.</seg>

<seg id=458>That's it?</seg>
<seg id=459>How did you like the museum, Eiko?</seg>

<seg id=461>Forty-two inches, please.</seg>
<seg id=462>Yes, we do have a few left.</seg>
<seg id=463>Just press this.</seg>
<seg id=464>How's school?</seg>
<seg id=465>Something's wrong with the bath.</seg>
<seg id=466>But for miniature bottles, the tax is based on volume, not the number.</seg>
<seg id=467>As cheap a place as possible.</seg>
<seg id=468>Okay.</seg>
<seg id=469>I have a reservation for tonight. My name is Tanaka.</seg>
<seg id=470>I see.</seg>
<seg id=471>All right.</seg>
<seg id=472>It's my pleasure.</seg>
<seg id=473>I locked myself out.</seg>
<seg id=474>Hard-boiled, please.</seg>
<seg id=475>I'm sorry I can't.</seg>
<seg id=476>Where do you buy her clothes?</seg>
<seg id=477>What is today's soup?</seg>

<seg id=2>I'm a professional singer.</seg>
<seg id=3>How can you get there?</seg>
<seg id=4>Call someone to carry my bags, please.</seg>
<seg id=5>What about this one?</seg>
<seg id=6>Just push this.</seg>
<seg id=7>I bought over-the-counter medicine.</seg>

<seg id=18>How long is the wait?</seg>
<seg id=19>I want to leave one day earlier than scheduled.</seg>
<seg id=20>Just a moment.</seg>
<seg id=21>Will you hold on to this for me while I go shopping?</seg>
<seg id=22>Oh, that's right. Is this OK?</seg>
<seg id=23>That's quite a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id=24>I'm placing a report with the Better Business Bureau.</seg>
<seg id=25>I don't feel well.</seg>
<seg id=26>I can't find this building anywhere.</seg>
<seg id=27>Excuse me.</seg>
<seg id=28>Is there anyplace to shop?</seg>
<seg id=29>Please ask me anytime.</seg>
<seg id=30>Do you think this color looks good on me?</seg>
<seg id=31>Surely not.</seg>
<seg id=32>There's not a thing to worry about. I know we'll do well.</seg>
<seg id=33>Please just use olive oil and vinegar.</seg>
<seg id=34>That tie looks good on you.</seg>
<seg id=35>Can you show me this one?</seg>
<seg id=36>Would you like a medium or a large?</seg>
<seg id=37>Are you done with dinner?</seg>
<seg id=38>I'll give you a prescription and you can get it filled at the pharmacy.</seg>
<seg id=39>Thank you.</seg>
<seg id=40>I would be grateful if you would.</seg>
<seg id=41>This is the purchase agreement.</seg>
<seg id=42>How does it look on me?</seg>
<seg id=43>Would you like the contents insured?</seg>
<seg id=44>Is it unlimited mileage?</seg>
<seg id=45>Can you tell me if there is an emergency hospital in the area?</seg>
<seg id=46>Alright. I think I can pay with coins.</seg>
<seg id=47>I suggest a lighter or a tie.</seg>
<seg id=48>Do you have this item in a size two smaller.</seg>
<seg id=49>Shall I gift-wrap them for you?</seg>
<seg id=50>Is there an introductory diving course?</seg>
<seg id=51>I want to reserve a flight for Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id=52>Do you know where the closest station is?</seg>
<seg id=53>Let's get together again.</seg>
<seg id=54>Huh?</seg>
<seg id=55>Is a reservation necessary?</seg>
<seg id=56>What's the difference between this one and that one?</seg>
<seg id=57>Could you give me a good deal?</seg>
<seg id=58>Can I go on with my trip?</seg>
<seg id=59>Yes. Across the street from the post office you can find it.</seg>
<seg id=60>I want to reserve a table for two for seven o'clock this evening.</seg>
<seg id=61>About five and a half hours more.</seg>
<seg id=62>What was it like?</seg>
<seg id=63>Make it a large one, please.</seg>
<seg id=64>By air or sea?</seg>
<seg id=65>Can I have your name again?</seg>
<seg id=66>But, I think you should stick to the main street. That's because it is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id=67>My friend has a son who is going to take an entrance exam for kindergarten.</seg>
<seg id=68>Could you give me a little bit of the cheese so I can taste it?</seg>
<seg id=69>Is it possible to return this?</seg>
<seg id=70>I'll start out with soup.</seg>
<seg id=71>I see. If you don't mind me saying so, eight hundred dollars for a one week cruise isn't quite luxurious enough. But, if you can be satisfied with a lower deck cabin, with no sea-view on a smaller boat, there are a few possibilities for you.</seg>
<seg id=72>On the fourth floor.</seg>
<seg id=73>I can't eat it all, so I'd like to take it home.</seg>
<seg id=74>Oh, you have a window seat. Come this way, please.</seg>
<seg id=75>How do I get the pump started?</seg>
<seg id=76>Please tell me your address.</seg>
<seg id=77>Is there a white one?</seg>
<seg id=78>Do you know where the closest Mexican restaurant is?</seg>
<seg id=79>Can I take a look at that jacket in the window?</seg>
<seg id=80>No, let's stop.</seg>
<seg id=81>It looks like rain.</seg>
<seg id=82>Would you like every topping?</seg>
<seg id=83>Where are you making your call from?</seg>
<seg id=84>Is Mr. Lee proficient in Japanese or English?</seg>
<seg id=85>Could you fix up my lips?</seg>
<seg id=86>Would you like something more to drink?</seg>
<seg id=87>Hello.</seg>
<seg id=88>I'll bring a size that is a little larger.</seg>
<seg id=89>Can I cash some traveler's checks?</seg>
<seg id=90>I'd like a room with a view of the mountain.</seg>
<seg id=91>Yes, I have it. Here you go.</seg>
<seg id=92>I want a painkiller.</seg>
<seg id=93>Please bring me some coffee later.</seg>
<seg id=94>Do you have any light food?</seg>
<seg id=95>Please show me how.</seg>
<seg id=96>Have a good night.</seg>
<seg id=97>The next item on the agenda is deciding when, or rather how quickly we should send our representative to that city.</seg>
<seg id=98>The clutch is out-of-order.</seg>
<seg id=99>I lost my money.</seg>
<seg id=100>Please give me one more.</seg>
<seg id=101>Does this style come in another size?</seg>
<seg id=102>Where do I transfer?</seg>
<seg id=103>We were cut off.</seg>
<seg id=104>Wonderful.</seg>
<seg id=105>Yes, I'll bring it over immediately.</seg>
<seg id=106>Do you know where the taxi stand is?</seg>
<seg id=107>Is there a market nearby?</seg>
<seg id=108>Of course.</seg>
<seg id=109>I'll get off at the next stop.</seg>
<seg id=110>What time do you open?</seg>
<seg id=111>Could you give me something for my indigestion.</seg>
<seg id=112>I'll have the same thing as him.</seg>
<seg id=113>The only money it costs is the two dollars, fifty cents for the bridge toll.</seg>
<seg id=114>Where is the closest bus stop?</seg>
<seg id=115>Do you want some wine with your meal?</seg>
<seg id=116>He confiscated my passport.</seg>
<seg id=117>You are traveling in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg id=118>Six nights.</seg>
<seg id=119>I locked myself out of my room.</seg>
<seg id=120>I don't need anything from you.</seg>
<seg id=121>What products is that town famous for?</seg>
<seg id=122>Can I make use of this insurance policy?</seg>
<seg id=123>Do you have any vegetarian dishes available?</seg>
<seg id=124>Do you know where the closest pharmacy is?</seg>

<seg id=127>No dressing on the salad, please.</seg>
<seg id=128>Does the apartment come with a parking space?</seg>
<seg id=129>I'd like some raw oysters.</seg>
<seg id=130>Hold on to the change.</seg>
<seg id=131>Please tell me how to get to the supermarket.</seg>
<seg id=132>The air-conditioner is out of order.</seg>
<seg id=133>No, there's no need for that.</seg>
<seg id=134>My baggage is gone.</seg>
<seg id=135>Too expensive.</seg>
<seg id=136>Please give me a receipt.</seg>
<seg id=137>I've got a terrible blister on my foot.</seg>
<seg id=138>No worries.</seg>
<seg id=139>It's a little bit too much.</seg>
<seg id=140>Do I need to make a reservation?</seg>
<seg id=141>Do I need to book the tickets beforehand?</seg>
<seg id=142>How much will the duty be on this?</seg>
<seg id=143>I want one infield ticket, please.</seg>
<seg id=144>Where can I catch a sightseeing bus?</seg>
<seg id=145>I'm sorry. Can you give me a hand?</seg>
<seg id=146>If it's not too much trouble for you.</seg>
<seg id=147>Could you open the window?</seg>
<seg id=148>I'll pay by card.</seg>
<seg id=149>How long is the wait?</seg>
<seg id=150>Yes. Please give me some small change.</seg>
<seg id=151>Too tight.</seg>
<seg id=152>That's for the appetizer.</seg>
<seg id=153>Is room service available?</seg>
<seg id=154>May I take your order?</seg>
<seg id=155>How much is a tomato?</seg>
<seg id=156>Please wait a moment. The number for S. Nicholas is three six four five seven four one.</seg>
<seg id=157>Is there a gift shop there?</seg>
<seg id=158>Are there any sightseeing buses for the inner city?</seg>
<seg id=159>Can you hold onto my coat, please?</seg>
<seg id=160>I can't work the heater.</seg>
<seg id=161>We haven't decided yet.</seg>
<seg id=162>Yes, what can I do for you?</seg>
<seg id=163>I don't know the size.</seg>
<seg id=164>Do you have any motion sickness pills?</seg>
<seg id=165>This dance is new to me.</seg>
<seg id=166>Is this car bound for Liverpool?</seg>
<seg id=167>How do you use this pump?</seg>
<seg id=168>Do you have something with a lighter color?</seg>
<seg id=169>I've been vomiting a lot.</seg>
<seg id=170>I want to be in Los Angeles between noon and two.</seg>
<seg id=171>That's not what I meant.</seg>
<seg id=172>I'm sorry, but they are already full.</seg>
<seg id=173>Do you have any medicine for a stomachache?</seg>
<seg id=174>Could you carry my luggage to the room?</seg>
<seg id=175>Please give me a cheeseburger, hold the tomato, with everything else.</seg>
<seg id=176>OK.</seg>
<seg id=177>Are there any other tours?</seg>
<seg id=178>Would you like to drink something cold with that?</seg>
<seg id=179>Yes, please hold for a moment.</seg>
<seg id=180>OK, I understand.</seg>
<seg id=181>I lost one of my fillings.</seg>
<seg id=182>In February, the coldest month of the year, it gets down to minus thirty degrees.</seg>
<seg id=183>This bill is incorrect.</seg>
<seg id=184>This mark is not one that I made.</seg>
<seg id=185>The weather is great today.</seg>
<seg id=186>What's today's special? Can you point to it on the menu, please?</seg>
<seg id=187>No, thanks.</seg>
<seg id=188>I'd like to be part of a tour. What sort of tours do you have?</seg>
<seg id=189>The palm of my right hand was scraped.</seg>
<seg id=190>This one and this one. One medium Coca-Cola, please.</seg>
<seg id=191>Would you like some lunch or something?</seg>
<seg id=192>Please don't kill me.</seg>
<seg id=193>It will be about three blocks down this street.</seg>
<seg id=194>Do you have room for ninety-nine people?</seg>
<seg id=195>Is there any way that is cheaper?</seg>
<seg id=196>Is the current a strong one?</seg>

<seg id=245>I want to see The Phantom of the Opera.</seg>
<seg id=246>Could you help me to carry this luggage?</seg>
<seg id=247>It's mistaken.</seg>
<seg id=248>Yes, that's true. What do you think would be a good souvenir for people back in Japan?</seg>
<seg id=249>Is there something you are looking for?</seg>
<seg id=250>Where are the chips?</seg>
<seg id=251>When can you bring it for me?</seg>
<seg id=252>Hello.</seg>
<seg id=253>Yes, these portions are big.</seg>
<seg id=254>Do you have any books written in Japanese?</seg>

<seg id=256>This key is the wrong one.</seg>
<seg id=257>Can I take your picture?</seg>
<seg id=258>How would you like your steak prepared?</seg>

<seg id=265>Thank you anyway.</seg>

<seg id=273>I work at a trading company.</seg>
<seg id=274>Let's do something together some day.</seg>
<seg id=275>What time do you open?</seg>
<seg id=276>Can I go on with my trip according to schedule?</seg>
<seg id=277>What's the problem with it?</seg>
<seg id=278>Turn left and walk three blocks.</seg>
<seg id=279>It was nice seeing you.</seg>
<seg id=280>I guess I'll see you then.</seg>
<seg id=281>OK, I'll take it then.</seg>
<seg id=282>That's fine.</seg>
<seg id=283>I use soft contact lenses.</seg>
<seg id=284>I'm Mari Mizuta. M-A-R-I M-I-Z-U-T-A.</seg>
<seg id=285>Do you know the gate number?</seg>
<seg id=286>It's wonderful being all alone with you.</seg>
<seg id=287>Could you show me your company's organization chart?</seg>
<seg id=288>Can I help you?</seg>
<seg id=289>Can I make my reservation right here?</seg>
<seg id=290>I've got some blisters on my feet. Do you carry Band-Aids?</seg>
<seg id=291>I can't find my skirt.</seg>
<seg id=292>Well, I'll give it a shot. Exactly where will your friend be waiting at Union Square?</seg>
<seg id=293>I'll go with you to the police station.</seg>
<seg id=294>My English is too poor to get it right away. May I take it home and come back tomorrow?</seg>
<seg id=295>Please open up your bag.</seg>
<seg id=296>What time do you want it for?</seg>
<seg id=297>Can I move to the front?</seg>
<seg id=298>I'm working for a Japanese brokerage house. I'm in its New York branch.</seg>
<seg id=299>This is a Japanese doll.</seg>
<seg id=300>The economic environment changes quickly, so the project is quite risky.</seg>
<seg id=301>Actually.</seg>
<seg id=302>Touring.</seg>
<seg id=303>My stomach seems to be upset.</seg>
<seg id=304>My feet are hurting.</seg>
<seg id=305>Can you clear off the table, please?</seg>
<seg id=306>I haven't decided yet.</seg>

<seg id=308>Do you know where the lost-and-found is?</seg>
<seg id=309>Where can I go to ride horses?</seg>

<seg id=316>Does this come in other colors?</seg>
<seg id=317>I'm very tired.</seg>

<seg id=360>Gorgeous.</seg>
<seg id=361>Would you alter this for me?</seg>
<seg id=362>Yes. This is it.</seg>
<seg id=363>Let's see each other this evening.</seg>
<seg id=364>Do you have tickets for the same day?</seg>
<seg id=365>Good, thank you. How about you?</seg>
<seg id=366>It feels nice.</seg>
<seg id=367>I'd like to make a flight reservation.</seg>
<seg id=368>That's terrible.</seg>

<seg id=394>Please go here.</seg>
<seg id=395>Please show me some lipstick.</seg>
<seg id=396>Would you measure my neck for me?</seg>
<seg id=397>I have chronic stomachaches.</seg>
<seg id=398>This doesn't fit.</seg>
<seg id=399>I don't have any interest.</seg>
<seg id=400>No more toilet paper.</seg>
<seg id=401>What's the difference between these two?</seg>
<seg id=402>I'll give you a prescription. Get it filled at the drugstore.</seg>
<seg id=403>I came to pick up my valuables.</seg>
<seg id=404>That has unlimited mileage.</seg>
<seg id=405>They're a bit too tight. Do you have any larger sizes? I'd like to try on the same thing in a different color.</seg>
<seg id=406>All together, how much is it?</seg>
<seg id=407>Evening.</seg>
<seg id=408>Here is your receipt.</seg>

<seg id=416>I'll take you to the airport.</seg>
<seg id=417>Of course.</seg>
<seg id=418>Could you give me a roll of black and white film?</seg>
<seg id=419>Do you have something a bit more conservative in this style?</seg>
<seg id=420>Is it alright if I use this card here?</seg>
<seg id=421>I forgot my passport in the taxi.</seg>
<seg id=422>Please talk slowly.</seg>
<seg id=423>I'll take this on the plane.</seg>
<seg id=424>I want to eat something.</seg>
<seg id=425>This food is awfully delicious.</seg>
<seg id=426>My chest is throbbing.</seg>
<seg id=427>Who is the scriptwriter?</seg>
<seg id=428>I want a compact car.</seg>
<seg id=429>The flight will be delayed an hour.</seg>
<seg id=430>So-so.</seg>
<seg id=431>How long will it take to have them reissued?</seg>
<seg id=432>How would you like your meat cooked?</seg>
<seg id=433>Alright. But, we're all booked up until next Monday.</seg>
<seg id=434>Please give me a medium.</seg>

<seg id=446>Tonight I would like to see an opera.</seg>
<seg id=447>I would like a room that is spacious, please.</seg>
<seg id=448>Put three grand on red, Jimmy.</seg>
<seg id=449>They are exempt from taxes.</seg>
<seg id=450>I have a bruise.</seg>
<seg id=451>Let's give you a shot.</seg>
<seg id=452>I need more small plates.</seg>
<seg id=453>Burglar.</seg>
<seg id=454>Do you know if there is a ticket agency nearby?</seg>
<seg id=455>No milk, thank you.</seg>
<seg id=456>There was nothing I could do about it.</seg>
<seg id=457>Do you have a cola?</seg>
<seg id=458>That's all?</seg>
<seg id=459>Eiko, how did you like your visit to the museum?</seg>

<seg id=462>Yes, we still have a few left.</seg>
<seg id=463>Just push this.</seg>
<seg id=464>How's school going?</seg>
<seg id=465>There is something wrong with the bath.</seg>
<seg id=466>However, the tax for miniature bottles is based on the volume, not on the number of bottles.</seg>
<seg id=467>The cheapest place possible.</seg>
<seg id=468>I see.</seg>
<seg id=469>I've got a reservation for tonight under Tanaka.</seg>
<seg id=470>I understand.</seg>
<seg id=471>Yes.</seg>
<seg id=472>No worries.</seg>
<seg id=473>I locked myself out of my room.</seg>
<seg id=474>A hard-boiled one, please.</seg>
<seg id=475>I'm sorry to say, but I can't</seg>
<seg id=476>Where do you get her clothes?</seg>
<seg id=477>What is the soup today?</seg>
<seg id=478>There is a chance you may be able to get on that flight.</seg>
<seg id=479>Did you make a reservation?</seg>
<seg id=480>Can I see a menu, please?</seg>

<seg id=496>I see.</seg>
<seg id=497>I want to take a look at the plant for A Company.</seg>
<seg id=498>How much does it cost for the all-day tour?</seg>

<doc docid="xxx" sysid="A3">
<seg id=1>Does the price cover dinner, too?</seg>
<seg id=2>My profession is singing.</seg>
<seg id=3>How does one get there?</seg>
<seg id=4>Please call someone to carry my bags.</seg>
<seg id=5>What do you think about this one?</seg>
<seg id=6>All you have to do is push this.</seg>
<seg id=7>I purchased an over-the-counter drug.</seg>
<seg id=8>Please bring another towel.</seg>
<seg id=9>This is different than what I ordered.</seg>
<seg id=10>Businesspeople in Japan believe that the wider their network is, the better. Doing business in their network, or having people in their network introduce them, they can get a good start.</seg>
<seg id=11>I'd like a pillow.</seg>
<seg id=12>I want to buy some souvenirs.</seg>
<seg id=13>When will the train arrive in Dover?</seg>
<seg id=14>Do you think I might get seasick?</seg>
<seg id=15>I would like to order now.</seg>
<seg id=16>Afternoon.</seg>
<seg id=17>A play is what I would like to see.</seg>
<seg id=18>How long do we need to wait?</seg>
<seg id=19>I want to leave a day sooner than I had planned.</seg>
<seg id=20>Just a second.</seg>
<seg id=21>Will you keep a hold of this for me while I'm shopping?</seg>
<seg id=22>Oh, that's correct. Is this alright?</seg>
<seg id=23>Quite a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id=24>I'm going to complain to the Better Business Bureau about you.</seg>
<seg id=25>I feel bad.</seg>
<seg id=26>I haven't been able to find this building.</seg>
<seg id=27>Hello, is anybody in?</seg>
<seg id=28>Is there anyplace where we can go shopping?</seg>
<seg id=29>You can ask me anytime.</seg>
<seg id=30>Is this a color that looks good on me?</seg>
<seg id=31>That can't be.</seg>
<seg id=32>There's nothing to worry about. We'll do alright.</seg>
<seg id=33>Olive oil and vinegar only, please.</seg>
<seg id=34>You look great with that tie.</seg>
<seg id=35>Please let me see this one?</seg>
<seg id=36>Would you like a medium or large size?</seg>
<seg id=37>Have you finished eating your dinner?</seg>
<seg id=38>I'll make out a prescription and the pharmacy will fill it for you.</seg>
<seg id=39>Thanks.</seg>
<seg id=40>I would really appreciate it if you would.</seg>
<seg id=41>Here is your purchase agreement.</seg>
<seg id=42>How does it look?</seg>
<seg id=43>Would you like to have the contents insured?</seg>
<seg id=44>Do I get unlimited mileage?</seg>
<seg id=45>Do you know if there is an emergency hospital around here?</seg>
<seg id=46>OK. I think I will be able to pay with coins.</seg>
<seg id=47>I recommend getting a lighter or a tie.</seg>
<seg id=48>Are there any of this in a size two smaller than this one?</seg>
<seg id=49>Would you like to have them gift-wrapped?</seg>
<seg id=50>Can I take part in an introductory diving course?</seg>
<seg id=51>I want to make reservations for a flight to Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id=52>Where is the station nearest to here?</seg>
<seg id=53>See you again.</seg>
<seg id=54>What?</seg>
<seg id=55>Is a reservation needed?</seg>
<seg id=56>What is the difference between these?</seg>
<seg id=57>Could you sweeten the deal a little bit?</seg>
<seg id=58>Can I continue traveling?</seg>
<seg id=59>Yes. You can find it across the street from the post office.</seg>
<seg id=60>I'd like to make reservations for a table for two at seven o'clock at night.</seg>
<seg id=61>About five and a half hours longer.</seg>
<seg id=62>What did you think of it?</seg>
<seg id=63>Large, please.</seg>
<seg id=64>Sea or air mail?</seg>
<seg id=65>Please give me your name again.</seg>
<seg id=66>But, I think it would be a good idea to stick to the main street. That's because it is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id=67>My friend's son will take a kindergarten entrance exam.</seg>
<seg id=68>Can I have a bite of the cheese so I can taste it?</seg>
<seg id=69>Is it alright if I return this?</seg>
<seg id=70>I'll begin with some soup.</seg>
<seg id=71>I see. If you don't mind me saying, eight hundred dollars for a one week cruise won't get you much luxury. But, if you can be satisfied with a cabin on the lower deck, without a view of the sea, on a smaller boat, then there are a few possibilities for you.</seg>
<seg id=72>You can find it on the fourth floor.</seg>
<seg id=73>I can't eat all of it, so I want to take it home.</seg>
<seg id=74>Oh, you are in a window seat. This way, please.</seg>
<seg id=75>How can I start the pump?</seg>
<seg id=76>Please tell me what your address is.</seg>
<seg id=77>Do you carry one in white?</seg>
<seg id=78>Where is the nearest Mexican restaurant?</seg>
<seg id=79>Can you show me the jacket in the window?</seg>
<seg id=80>Let's not do it.</seg>
<seg id=81>It looks like it will rain.</seg>
<seg id=82>Would you like me to put everything on it?</seg>
<seg id=83>Where are you placing your call from?</seg>
<seg id=84>Are Japanese or English languages that Mr. Lee can speak?</seg>
<seg id=85>Could you take care of my lips?</seg>
<seg id=86>Would you like another drink?</seg>
<seg id=87>Afternoon.</seg>
<seg id=88>I'll bring a bigger size.</seg>
<seg id=89>Is it alright if I cash some traveler's checks?</seg>
<seg id=90>I'd like a room on the mountain side.</seg>
<seg id=91>Yes, I've got it. Here it is.</seg>
<seg id=92>A painkiller is what I want.</seg>
<seg id=93>Coffee afterwards, please.</seg>
<seg id=94>Are there any light dishes?</seg>
<seg id=95>Please show me how to do it.</seg>
<seg id=96>Have a pleasant night.</seg>
<seg id=97>Deciding when, or rather how quickly we should send our representative to that city, is the next item on the agenda.</seg>
<seg id=98>The clutch is not functioning correctly.</seg>
<seg id=99>My money is lost.</seg>
<seg id=100>I'd like one more, please.</seg>
<seg id=101>Is there another size for this style?</seg>
<seg id=102>Where will I transfer?</seg>
<seg id=103>The connection was lost.</seg>
<seg id=104>Great.</seg>
<seg id=105>Certainly, I'll have it for you right away.</seg>
<seg id=106>Where is the taxi stand?</seg>
<seg id=107>Do you know if there is a market close by?</seg>
<seg id=108>You bet.</seg>
<seg id=109>I'll be getting off at the next stop.</seg>
<seg id=110>What are your operating hours?</seg>
<seg id=111>Could I have something that will take care of my indigestion?</seg>
<seg id=112>I'll have what he's having.</seg>
<seg id=113>It only costs two dollars and fifty cents for the bridge toll.</seg>
<seg id=114>Where is the bus stop that is closest to here?</seg>
<seg id=115>Would you like some wine with dinner?</seg>
<seg id=116>He is holding onto my passport.</seg>
<seg id=117>This is the wrong direction.</seg>
<seg id=118>It's for six nights.</seg>
<seg id=119>My key is locked in my room.</seg>
<seg id=120>You're poking your nose in where is doesn't belong.</seg>
<seg id=121>What products from that town are famous?</seg>
<seg id=122>Is it alright to use this insurance policy?</seg>
<seg id=123>Are there any vegetarian dishes?</seg>
<seg id=124>Where is the pharmacy closest to here?</seg>
<seg id=125>I'm especially fond of the guitar.</seg>
<seg id=126>What model were you wanting?</seg>
<seg id=127>I don't want any dressing on the salad.</seg>
<seg id=128>Is there a parking space with the apartment?</seg>
<seg id=129>Raw oysters please.</seg>
<seg id=130>Please keep the change.</seg>
<seg id=131>Do you know the way to the supermarket?</seg>
<seg id=132>The air-conditioner is broken.</seg>
<seg id=133>No, that's OK.</seg>
<seg id=134>My bags are not here.</seg>
<seg id=135>Too much.</seg>
<seg id=136>Please make out a receipt.</seg>
<seg id=137>My foot has a terrible blister on it.</seg>
<seg id=138>Don't mention it.</seg>
<seg id=139>It's a bit too costly.</seg>
<seg id=140>Do I have to call ahead for a reservation?</seg>
<seg id=141>Will I need to book tickets ahead of time?</seg>
<seg id=142>What is the duty on this?</seg>
<seg id=143>Please give me one infield ticket.</seg>
<seg id=144>Do you know where I can get on a sightseeing bus?</seg>
<seg id=145>Excuse me. Can you lend me a hand?</seg>
<seg id=146>If it doesn't cause too much trouble for you.</seg>
<seg id=147>Would you open the window, please?</seg>
<seg id=148>I'll charge it.</seg>
<seg id=149>What kind of wait is there?</seg>
<seg id=150>Yes. Some small change, too, please.</seg>
<seg id=151>This is way too tight.</seg>
<seg id=152>That's the appetizer.</seg>
<seg id=153>Do you know if they have room service?</seg>
<seg id=154>Have you decided?</seg>
<seg id=155>How much does a tomato cost?</seg>
<seg id=156>Please wait a moment. The number, three six four five seven four one, is the number for S. Nicholas.</seg>
<seg id=157>Do you know if there is a gift shop?</seg>
<seg id=158>Do you know of any sightseeing buses for the inner city?</seg>
<seg id=159>Can you please hold onto my coat?</seg>
<seg id=160>I don't know how to operate the heater.</seg>
<seg id=161>We aren't sure yet.</seg>
<seg id=162>Yes, how can I help you?</seg>
<seg id=163>I don't know what the size is.</seg>
<seg id=164>Do you have any pills to prevent motion sickness?</seg>
<seg id=165>I am not very familiar with this dance.</seg>
<seg id=166>Will this car stop in Liverpool?</seg>
<seg id=167>How does this pump work?</seg>
<seg id=168>Do you have one in a lighter color?</seg>
<seg id=169>I keep vomiting.</seg>
<seg id=170>Between noon and two I want to arrive in Los Angeles.</seg>
<seg id=171>That isn't what I meant at all.</seg>
<seg id=172>I'm sorry to say the seats are full.</seg>
<seg id=173>Do you have anything to take care of a stomachache?</seg>
<seg id=174>Would you mind taking my baggage to my room?</seg>
<seg id=175>I would like a cheeseburger with everything but tomatoes on it, please.</seg>
<seg id=176>No worries.</seg>
<seg id=177>Do you know if there are any other tours?</seg>
<seg id=178>Would you like a cold drink with that?</seg>
<seg id=179>Yes, please hold.</seg>
<seg id=180>OK, I see.</seg>
<seg id=181>One of my fillings came out.</seg>
<seg id=182>The coldest month of the year is February, when it gets down to minus thirty degrees.</seg>
<seg id=183>This bill is not right.</seg>
<seg id=184>It wasn't me who made this mark.</seg>
<seg id=185>We have blue skies today.</seg>
<seg id=186>What's your special today? Could you point it out on the menu, please?</seg>
<seg id=187>I don't need any.</seg>
<seg id=188>I'd like to join a tour. What kind of tours are there?</seg>
<seg id=189>I scraped up my right palm.</seg>
<seg id=190>This and this. A medium Coke, please.</seg>
<seg id=191>How about lunch or something?</seg>
<seg id=192>Please spare me.</seg>
<seg id=193>You'll find it about three blocks down this street.</seg>
<seg id=194>Do you have seating available for ninety-nine people?</seg>
<seg id=195>Is there a cheaper way?</seg>
<seg id=196>Is it a strong current?</seg>
<seg id=197>How long will the wait be?</seg>

<seg id=299>A Japanese doll.</seg>
<seg id=300>The project is quite risky because the economic environment changes quickly.</seg>
<seg id=301>In truth.</seg>
<seg id=302>Traveling.</seg>
<seg id=303>My stomach appears to be rebelling.</seg>
<seg id=304>My feet are killing me.</seg>

<seg id=326>Right on.</seg>
<seg id=327>If I want to get off, do I push this?</seg>

<seg id=329>Your reservation has been reconfirmed.</seg>

<seg id=366>That feels great.</seg>
<seg id=367>I want to reserve a flight.</seg>
<seg id=368>What a terrible thing.</seg>
<seg id=369>Can I have it delivered by tomorrow?</seg>
<seg id=370>I'll have one of the same.</seg>
<seg id=371>My pleasure.</seg>
<seg id=372>Until what time can I return the car?</seg>
<seg id=373>I'm sorry. Could you please say that again?</seg>
<seg id=374>It made me open up my eyes.</seg>
<seg id=375>Are there any forks and knives made out of plastic?</seg>

<seg id=394>Please take me here.</seg>
<seg id=395>I would like to see some lipstick.</seg>
<seg id=396>Please measure my neck for me.</seg>
<seg id=397>I'm suffering from chronic stomachaches.</seg>
<seg id=398>It's the wrong size.</seg>
<seg id=399>I have no interest.</seg>
<seg id=400>The toilet paper is gone.</seg>
<seg id=401>What is different between this one and that one?</seg>
<seg id=402>I'll make out a prescription. The drugstore will fill it for you.</seg>
<seg id=403>I came to pick up valuables you are holding for me.</seg>
<seg id=404>There is unlimited mileage.</seg>
<seg id=405>They're a bit tight. Do you have it in a larger size? I'd like to try it in a different color.</seg>

<seg id=419>Is there anything in the style a little more conservative?</seg>
<seg id=420>Can I use this card?</seg>
<seg id=421>I left my passport behind in the taxi.</seg>
<seg id=422>Please speak at a slow rate.</seg>
<seg id=423>I'll bring this on-board.</seg>
<seg id=424>I would like to eat something.</seg>
<seg id=425>This is really good food.</seg>
<seg id=426>I have a throbbing in my chest.</seg>
<seg id=427>Who composed the script?</seg>
<seg id=428>I'd like a compact.</seg>
<seg id=429>The flight is an hour behind schedule.</seg>
<seg id=430>OK.</seg>
<seg id=431>In order to reissue them, how much time will take?</seg>
<seg id=432>How would you like to have your meat cooked?</seg>

<seg id=451>I'll give a shot to you.</seg>
<seg id=452>More small plates, please.</seg>
<seg id=453>Robber.</seg>
<seg id=454>Can you tell me if there is a ticket agency close by?</seg>
<seg id=455>No thanks, I don't need milk.</seg>
<seg id=456>There wasn't a thing I could do about it.</seg>

<seg id=467>A place as cheap as possible.</seg>
<seg id=468>I understand.</seg>
<seg id=469>I made reservations for tonight under the name of Tanaka.</seg>
<seg id=470>Alright.</seg>
<seg id=471>OK.</seg>

<seg id=473>My key is locked in my room.</seg>
<seg id=474>Please give me a hard-boiled one.</seg>
<seg id=475>I'm sorry, but I just cannot.</seg>
<seg id=476>Where do you buy clothes for her?</seg>
<seg id=477>What is the soup of the day?</seg>

<seg id=5>How do you like this one?</seg>
<seg id=6>All you need to do is to push this button.</seg>
<seg id=7>The medicine was purchased over-the-counter.</seg>
<seg id=8>Another towel, please.</seg>
<seg id=9>This is not the same as what I ordered.</seg>
<seg id=10>Japanese businesspeople feel the bigger their network the better. If they do business in their network, or have people in their network introduce them, they can get their business off to a good start.</seg>
<seg id=11>I want a pillow.</seg>
<seg id=12>I'm hoping to buy some souvenirs.</seg>

<seg id=23>That's a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id=24>I'm lodging a complaint with the Better Business Bureau about you.</seg>
<seg id=25>I'm feeling sick.</seg>
<seg id=26>I can't seem to find this building.</seg>
<seg id=27>Hi.</seg>
<seg id=28>Is there a good place to shop?</seg>
<seg id=29>Please feel free to ask me anytime.</seg>
<seg id=30>Is this color one that looks good on me?</seg>
<seg id=31>No way.</seg>
<seg id=32>No worries. I'm sure we'll do well.</seg>
<seg id=33>Please stick to olive oil and vinegar only, please.</seg>
<seg id=34>That tie is perfect for you.</seg>
<seg id=35>Can I take a look at this one?</seg>
<seg id=36>Do you want medium or large?</seg>
<seg id=37>Are you finished with your dinner?</seg>
<seg id=38>I'll give you a prescription and you can ask the pharmacy to fill it for you.</seg>
<seg id=39>Thanks a lot.</seg>
<seg id=40>If you would, I would be grateful.</seg>
<seg id=41>This here is your purchase agreement.</seg>

<seg id=43>Would you like to insure what you are shipping?</seg>
<seg id=44>Does it come with free mileage?</seg>
<seg id=45>Do you know if an emergency hospital is anywhere nearby?</seg>

<seg id=48>Do you have this in a size two smaller?</seg>
<seg id=49>Would you like me to gift-wrap them for you?</seg>
<seg id=50>Do you have an introductory diving course?</seg>
<seg id=51>I want to reserve a seat on a flight for Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id=52>Where can I find the nearest station?</seg>
<seg id=53>Until we meet again.</seg>
<seg id=54>Pardon?</seg>
<seg id=55>Do I have to have a reservation?</seg>
<seg id=56>What is the difference between these two?</seg>
<seg id=57>Could you give a discount to me?</seg>
<seg id=58>Can I keep traveling?</seg>
<seg id=59>Yes. There's one opposite the post office.</seg>
<seg id=60>I want to reserve a table for two for seven o'clock this evening.</seg>
<seg id=61>About five and a half hours to go.</seg>
<seg id=62>How was it?</seg>
<seg id=63>Please make it a large.</seg>
<seg id=64>Do you want to ship it by air or sea?</seg>
<seg id=65>Could you give me your name again?</seg>
<seg id=66>But, you really ought to stick to the main street. That's because it is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id=67>My friend's son will be taking an entrance exam for kindergarten.</seg>
<seg id=68>Can I get a taste of the cheese?</seg>
<seg id=69>Is this something I can return?</seg>
<seg id=70>I'll have some soup for starters.</seg>
<seg id=71>I see. If you don't mind me saying, eight hundred dollars for a week long cruise won't get you much luxury. But, if a lower deck cabin, without a view, on a smaller boat is OK, then there are two or three possibilities for you.</seg>
<seg id=72>It's located on the fourth floor.</seg>
<seg id=73>I can't eat it all, so please put it in a doggy bag.</seg>
<seg id=74>Oh, you are seated in a window seat. Please come this way.</seg>
<seg id=75>How is the pump started?</seg>
<seg id=76>Please tell me where you live.</seg>
<seg id=77>Are there any white ones?</seg>
<seg id=78>Where can I find a Mexican restaurant close-by?</seg>
<seg id=79>Would you let me see that jacket in the window.</seg>
<seg id=80>Let's give up on that.</seg>
<seg id=81>It looks like rain is coming.</seg>
<seg id=82>Would you like all of the toppings on it?</seg>
<seg id=83>From where are you calling?</seg>
<seg id=84>Is Mr. Lee able to speak in Japanese or English?</seg>
<seg id=85>Could you put more lipstick on my lips?</seg>
<seg id=86>Is there any other drink I can get you?</seg>

<seg id=2>I sing.</seg>
<seg id=3>How would I get there?</seg>
<seg id=4>Please call the concierge.</seg>
<seg id=5>What about this one?</seg>
<seg id=6>Just push here.</seg>
<seg id=7>I bought some over the counter medicine.</seg>
<seg id=8>Can I get you to bring me another towel?</seg>
<seg id=9>This is not what I ordered.</seg>
<seg id=10>For people in Japan who do business, the more extensive their network is, the better. When the work is done with the members of that network or by people who are introduced, then their business will be off to a good start.</seg>
<seg id=11>I'd like a pillow.</seg>
<seg id=12>I plan to go get some souvenirs.</seg>
<seg id=13>What time will it be when the train gets to Dover?</seg>
<seg id=14>Do you think there is the possibility that I'll get seasick?</seg>
<seg id=15>There's something that I'd like to order, if I could.</seg>
<seg id=16>Hi.</seg>
<seg id=17>I'd love to go to a play.</seg>
<seg id=18>How long is the wait?</seg>
<seg id=19>I'd like to leave a day earlier.</seg>
<seg id=20>Just a second.</seg>
<seg id=21>Could you watch this for me while I'm shopping?</seg>
<seg id=22>Oh, right. Is this okay?</seg>
<seg id=23>That's unusual.</seg>
<seg id=24>I will let the Better Business Bureau know about this.</seg>
<seg id=25>I don't feel good.</seg>
<seg id=26>I can't locate this building.</seg>
<seg id=27>Excuse me.</seg>
<seg id=28>Is there a place to shop?</seg>
<seg id=29>Please ask me as you feel the need.</seg>
<seg id=30>Is this a good color on me?</seg>
<seg id=31>For real?</seg>
<seg id=32>There's no reason to be concerned. It will be just fine.</seg>
<seg id=33>Just olive oil and vinegar for me, please.</seg>
<seg id=34>That tie looks good on you.</seg>
<seg id=35>May I have a look at this one?</seg>
<seg id=36>Do you want a medium or a large?</seg>
<seg id=37>Are you done with your meal?</seg>
<seg id=38>I'll let you have a prescription and you can take it to a drugstore to fill it.</seg>
<seg id=39>Thank you so much.</seg>
<seg id=40>I'd be so grateful if you would.</seg>
<seg id=41>This is the purchasing documentation.</seg>
<seg id=42>How does it look on me?</seg>
<seg id=43>Would you like insurance on that?</seg>
<seg id=44>Do you get unlimited mileage with that?</seg>
<seg id=45>Is there a hospital around here that deals with emergencies?</seg>
<seg id=46>All right. I'll most likely be able to use coins.</seg>
<seg id=47>I'd say a lighter or a tie would be good.</seg>
<seg id=48>Is there something two sizes smaller?</seg>
<seg id=49>Shall I gift-wrap them?</seg>
<seg id=50>Can I try the trial diving class?</seg>
<seg id=51>I'd like to reserve a seat on a flight to Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id=52>Where would the closest station be?</seg>
<seg id=53>See you in a bit.</seg>
<seg id=54>Huh?</seg>
<seg id=55>Is a reservation necessary?</seg>
<seg id=56>What's the difference between this and that?</seg>
<seg id=57>Could you knock something off the price?</seg>
<seg id=58>Can I keep traveling?</seg>
<seg id=59>Yes. There is one right across the street opposite the post office.</seg>
<seg id=60>I'd like to make a reservation for two for seven p.m.</seg>
<seg id=61>It's still about another five hours and a half.</seg>
<seg id=62>What kind is it?</seg>
<seg id=63>Please give me a large one.</seg>
<seg id=64>Would you like it by air or surface?</seg>
<seg id=65>Could you tell me your name again?</seg>
<seg id=66>But, it's better if you stay on the main streets as it can be dangerous.</seg>
<seg id=67>The son of a friend of mine is going to take an entrance exam to get into kindergarten.</seg>
<seg id=68>Could I have a little cheese just so I can see how it tastes?</seg>
<seg id=69>Is this returnable?</seg>
<seg id=70>I'd like to have soup for a starter.</seg>
<seg id=71>Yes, well, actually if I may say so, for a one week cruise, eight hundred dollars won't be so luxurious. But, if you are OK with being on a smaller ship in a cabin on a lower deck with no view of the ocean, there are two or three options.</seg>
<seg id=72>You'd go to the fourth floor for that.</seg>
<seg id=73>We can't finish it so we want to take it home.</seg>
<seg id=74>Ah, it's a window seat. Right this way, please.</seg>
<seg id=75>How do I get the pump to start?</seg>
<seg id=76>Please let me know your address.</seg>
<seg id=77>Have you got a white one?</seg>
<seg id=78>Where would I find the nearest Mexican restaurant?</seg>
<seg id=79>Could you show me that jacket in the window?</seg>
<seg id=80>No, that's no good.</seg>
<seg id=81>It looks like rain.</seg>
<seg id=82>Did you want that with everything?</seg>
<seg id=83>Where are you making this call from?</seg>
<seg id=84>Does Mr. Li speak either Japanese or English?</seg>
<seg id=85>Would you mind giving my lips a bit of a touch up?</seg>
<seg id=86>Do you want some other drink?</seg>
<seg id=87>Hi.</seg>
<seg id=88>I'll go get one that's one size bigger.</seg>
<seg id=89>I'd like to get some cash for my traveler's checks.</seg>
<seg id=90>I'd like a room with a mountain view.</seg>

<seg id=93>Later, I'd like coffee, please.</seg>
<seg id=94>Is there something that's not heavy?</seg>
<seg id=95>Could you explain how it works?</seg>
<seg id=96>Night.</seg>
<seg id=97>The next item of business is to figure out when, or rather, how soon we should send a representative to that city.</seg>
<seg id=98>The clutch doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id=99>My money is missing.</seg>
<seg id=100>Another, please.</seg>
<seg id=101>Is there of in this style but another size?</seg>
<seg id=102>Where would I transfer?</seg>

<seg id=105>Sure, I'll bring it right there.</seg>
<seg id=106>Where is the taxi stand?</seg>
<seg id=107>Is there a market around here?</seg>
<seg id=108>Of course.</seg>
<seg id=109>I'll get out at the next stop.</seg>
<seg id=110>What time do you open up?</seg>
<seg id=111>I'd like to get some medicine for indigestion.</seg>
<seg id=112>Make mine the same as his.</seg>
<seg id=113>It's just the toll for the bridge of two fifty.</seg>
<seg id=114>Where is the closest bus stop?</seg>
<seg id=115>Would you like some wine with your meal?</seg>
<seg id=116>He's got my passport.</seg>
<seg id=117>You are heading in the opposite direction.</seg>
<seg id=118>It'll be six nights.</seg>
<seg id=119>I forgot my key in the room and walked out and the door locked behind me.</seg>
<seg id=120>It's none of your concern.</seg>

<seg id=129>I want to eat some oysters, raw.</seg>
<seg id=130>Don't worry about the change.</seg>
<seg id=131>Could you tell me the way to the supermarket?</seg>
<seg id=132>The air-conditioning isn't working.</seg>
<seg id=133>No, there's no necessity for that.</seg>
<seg id=134>My luggage is missing.</seg>
<seg id=135>It's too high.</seg>
<seg id=136>A receipt, please.</seg>
<seg id=137>I've got a horrendous blister from my shoe.</seg>
<seg id=138>Don't mention it.</seg>
<seg id=139>It's a bit too high.</seg>
<seg id=140>Is a reservation necessary?</seg>
<seg id=141>Do I need to get tickets in advance?</seg>
<seg id=142>What's the duty on this?</seg>
<seg id=143>Can I have one ticket for an infield seat?</seg>
<seg id=144>Where could I find a tour bus?</seg>
<seg id=145>Sorry. Could you give me a hand?</seg>
<seg id=146>If you are sure it isn't too much of a hassle.</seg>
<seg id=147>Could you open the window?</seg>
<seg id=148>I'll pay by credit card.</seg>
<seg id=149>How long will the wait be?</seg>
<seg id=150>Right. Please give me some change with that, too.</seg>

<seg id=154>Would you like to order now?</seg>
<seg id=155>What do the tomatoes cost?</seg>

<seg id=359>What time will we touch down in New York?</seg>
<seg id=360>Gorgeous.</seg>

<seg id=362>Sure. It's this one.</seg>
<seg id=363>See you this evening.</seg>
<seg id=364>Have you got today's tickets?</seg>
<seg id=365>OK, thanks. How about you?</seg>
<seg id=366>That feels very pleasant, doesn't it?</seg>
<seg id=367>I'd like to make a plane reservation.</seg>
<seg id=368>That is awful.</seg>
<seg id=369>Can it be delivered by tomorrow?</seg>
<seg id=370>I'll take the same thing.</seg>
<seg id=371>Not at all.</seg>
<seg id=372>What time should I have the car back by?</seg>
<seg id=373>Excuse me. Would you say that again, please?</seg>
<seg id=374>It caused my eyes to fly open.</seg>
<seg id=375>Have you got plastic cutlery?</seg>
<seg id=376>No, it's for personal use.</seg>
<seg id=377>Thanks.</seg>
<seg id=378>It's so good to see you here.</seg>
<seg id=379>What kind of live shows do they have there that we could see?</seg>
<seg id=380>Here's the numbers of the checks.</seg>
<seg id=381>I won't be back until late tonight.</seg>
<seg id=382>I can't find my luggage.</seg>
<seg id=383>Wouldn't you want to go swimming?</seg>
<seg id=384>Nobody is answering.</seg>
<seg id=385>How long will it take to get it reissued?</seg>
<seg id=386>How do you want your eggs cooked?</seg>
<seg id=387>I'd like the change, please.</seg>
<seg id=388>I'd like this one, please.</seg>
<seg id=389>OK if I take a photo here?</seg>
<seg id=390>Could you please speak up?</seg>
<seg id=391>I have a hard time understanding English.</seg>
<seg id=392>This style is very appealing. What colors are there?</seg>
<seg id=393>I'd like to see some tinted lenses, please.</seg>
<seg id=394>Please get me to this place.</seg>
<seg id=395>Please let me see some lipstick.</seg>
<seg id=396>Would you measure my neck, please?</seg>
<seg id=397>I suffer from chronic stomachaches.</seg>
<seg id=398>It's not the right size.</seg>
<seg id=399>It doesn't interest me.</seg>
<seg id=400>It's out of toilet paper.</seg>
<seg id=401>What is different between this one and that?</seg>
<seg id=402>I'll write you a prescription. Take it to a drugstore.</seg>
<seg id=403>I'd like to get my valuables that I left, please.</seg>
<seg id=404>The mileage on that is unlimited.</seg>
<seg id=405>They fit a little tightly. Could you give me some that are a little bigger? I'd like to check the fit of the same ones in a different color.</seg>
<seg id=406>What is the total cost?</seg>
<seg id=407>Hello.</seg>
<seg id=408>The receipt is right here.</seg>
<seg id=409>Could you change this for me, please?</seg>
<seg id=410>What do you think of these?</seg>
<seg id=411>That would be Mount Bromo.</seg>
<seg id=412>What?</seg>
<seg id=413>I'll have a bourbon and water, please.</seg>
<seg id=414>Sorry to bother you but would you mind just taking a quick shot of us?</seg>
<seg id=415>Would you like to have some coffee or some tea?</seg>
<seg id=416>I'll take you to the airport.</seg>
<seg id=417>Of course.</seg>
<seg id=418>Could I please get a roll of black and white film?</seg>
<seg id=419>Do you have something similar but in a plainer color?</seg>
<seg id=420>Do you take this card here?</seg>
<seg id=421>I forgot my passport in the cab.</seg>
<seg id=422>Please slow down when you speak.</seg>
<seg id=423>I'm going to carry this on.</seg>
<seg id=424>I'd like to eat.</seg>
<seg id=425>This food is really delicious.</seg>
<seg id=426>My chest is aching.</seg>
<seg id=427>Who authored the script?</seg>
<seg id=428>I want a compact.</seg>
<seg id=429>There has been a one-hour delay for this flight.</seg>
<seg id=430>A bit.</seg>
<seg id=431>How much time does it take to have them reissued?</seg>
<seg id=432>How would you like your meat cooked?</seg>
<seg id=433>Yes. But we are completely sold out until next Monday.</seg>
<seg id=434>Give me a medium, please.</seg>
<seg id=435>I saw a hit and run.</seg>
<seg id=436>I want to reserve a seat for August thirtieth on a flight to New York.</seg>
<seg id=437>What will it be for one night?</seg>
<seg id=438>It's cold.</seg>

<seg id=440>Where should I sign?</seg>
<seg id=441>I'd like a hotel close to Hyde Park, please.</seg>
<seg id=442>Do I need reservations for the dining car?</seg>
<seg id=443>This size doesn't work for me. Is it possible for me to exchange it for a different one?</seg>
<seg id=444>What does your handicap run?</seg>
<seg id=445>For sure he will be here.</seg>
<seg id=446>I'd like to go to an opera tonight.</seg>
<seg id=447>I'd like a roomy room, please.</seg>
<seg id=448>Jimmy, put three thousand bucks on the red.</seg>
<seg id=449>There is no tax on those.</seg>
<seg id=450>I got bruised.</seg>
<seg id=451>I'll give you an injection.</seg>
<seg id=452>Could you give us more plates?</seg>
<seg id=453>Robber.</seg>
<seg id=454>Is there a ticket sales place close to here?</seg>
<seg id=455>I'm fine without milk, thanks.</seg>
<seg id=456>There was nothing I could do about it.</seg>
<seg id=457>Have you got some kind of cola?</seg>
<seg id=458>That's all there is to it?</seg>
<seg id=459>How was the museum, Eiko?</seg>
<seg id=460>It is forbidden to take photos in the airport.</seg>
<seg id=461>I'd like forty-two inches.</seg>
<seg id=462>Sure, there are a few left.</seg>
<seg id=463>Just push here.</seg>
<seg id=464>How is school going?</seg>
<seg id=465>There's a problem with the bath.</seg>
<seg id=466>But in the case of miniature bottles, the tax is based on the volume rather than on the number.</seg>
<seg id=467>A place that is as cheap as possible.</seg>
<seg id=468>All right.</seg>
<seg id=469>My name is Tanaka and I've got a reservation for tonight.</seg>
<seg id=470>Okay.</seg>
<seg id=471>OK.</seg>
<seg id=472>I'm happy to do so.</seg>
<seg id=473>I forgot my key and the door locked behind me.</seg>
<seg id=474>Please make it hard-boiled.</seg>
<seg id=475>I regret to say it, but I can't.</seg>
<seg id=476>Where do you get her clothes?</seg>
<seg id=477>What's the soup of the day?</seg>
<seg id=478>There is a slight chance that you can board that flight.</seg>
<seg id=479>Did you make a reservation?</seg>
<seg id=480>Could you give me a menu, please?</seg>

<seg id=496>Absolutely.</seg>
<seg id=497>I'd like to take a look at A Company's factory.</seg>
<seg id=498>How much is it for the full day tour?</seg>
<seg id=499>There is no one called Suzuki here.</seg>

</doc>
<doc docid="xxx" sysid="A6">
<seg id=1>Do we get dinner too at that price?</seg>
<seg id=2>Singing is my field.</seg>
<seg id=3>What would I do to get there?</seg>
<seg id=4>Get somebody from the concierge.</seg>
<seg id=5>What do you think of this one?</seg>
<seg id=6>All you do is press here.</seg>
<seg id=7>I purchased some over the counter medication.</seg>
<seg id=8>Could you get me another towel?</seg>
<seg id=9>This is not the dish I ordered.</seg>
<seg id=10>For those in Japan doing business, the more contacts they have, the better. If the business is carried out with those contacts or with other people who have been introduced, then their work will start off on the right foot.</seg>
<seg id=11>I want a pillow.</seg>
<seg id=12>I'm planning to buy some souvenirs.</seg>
<seg id=13>What's the train's arrival time in Dover?</seg>
<seg id=14>Do you think I might get seasick?</seg>
<seg id=15>There is something that I want to order, please.</seg>
<seg id=16>Hello.</seg>
<seg id=17>I really want to see a play.</seg>
<seg id=18>What's the waiting time?</seg>
<seg id=19>I'd like to go a day ahead of schedule.</seg>
<seg id=20>Hold on for a second.</seg>
<seg id=21>Would you hold onto this for me while I shop?</seg>
<seg id=22>Oh, that's true. Would this be okay?</seg>
<seg id=23>That is odd.</seg>
<seg id=24>I will go to the Better Business Bureau about this.</seg>
<seg id=25>I'm not feeling well.</seg>
<seg id=26>I can't see where this building is.</seg>
<seg id=27>Hi, anybody here?</seg>
<seg id=28>Is there someplace to do some shopping?</seg>
<seg id=29>Please ask me whenever you want to.</seg>
<seg id=30>Does this color do anything for me?</seg>
<seg id=31>You're kidding!</seg>
<seg id=32>There's no reason for concern. Everything will go just fine.</seg>
<seg id=33>Please just give me olive oil and vinegar.</seg>
<seg id=34>That tie is you.</seg>
<seg id=35>Could I take a look at this one?</seg>
<seg id=36>Is that a medium or a large?</seg>
<seg id=37>Are you still working on your meal?</seg>
<seg id=38>I'll issue you a prescription and then you can have a pharmacy fill it for you.</seg>
<seg id=39>I really thank you.</seg>
<seg id=40>I'd really be indebted to you if you could.</seg>
<seg id=41>Here it is, the purchasing papers.</seg>
<seg id=42>Do it look OK?</seg>
<seg id=43>Do you want that insured?</seg>
<seg id=44>Is there unlimited mileage?</seg>
<seg id=45>Is there an emergency clinic in the vicinity?</seg>
<seg id=46>Sure. Probably I'll be able to pay in coins.</seg>
<seg id=47>I'd advise you to get a lighter or a tie.</seg>
<seg id=48>Would you have something two sizes smaller than this?</seg>
<seg id=49>Can I gift wrap those for you?</seg>
<seg id=50>May I take the trial diving course?</seg>
<seg id=51>I'd like to make a seat reservation for Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id=52>Where is the station that is closest to here?</seg>
<seg id=53>See you soon.</seg>
<seg id=54>What?</seg>
<seg id=55>Is a reservation required?</seg>
<seg id=56>What is there that is any different about that one as oppose to this one?</seg>
<seg id=57>Could you lower the price for me?</seg>
<seg id=58>Will I be able to continue my trip?</seg>
<seg id=59>That's right. It's there, across from the post office.</seg>
<seg id=60>I want to book a table for two of us for seven this evening.</seg>
<seg id=61>We've still got about five and a half hours to go.</seg>
<seg id=62>What type is that?</seg>
<seg id=63>I'd like to have that in a large, please.</seg>
<seg id=64>Is it going by air or surface?</seg>
<seg id=65>Could you say your name once more?</seg>
<seg id=66>However, it would be better for you to keep to the main streets since it is dangerous.</seg>
<seg id=67>My friend's boy is going to take a test to be admitted into kindergarten.</seg>
<seg id=68>May I try a little piece of the cheese so I can see what it tastes like?</seg>
<seg id=69>Will you take this back?</seg>
<seg id=70>I'll begin with soup, please.</seg>
<seg id=71>Right, well, if I may be so bold as to say so, eight hundred dollars for a one-week cruise won't be the top of the line. But, if you don't mind a smaller boat and a cabin on a lower deck where you can't see the ocean, there are a few choices.</seg>
<seg id=72>That would be on floor four.</seg>
<seg id=73>We can't finish it so we'd like a doggy bag.</seg>
<seg id=74>Oh, a window seat. Over here, please.</seg>
<seg id=75>How do I get the pump started?</seg>
<seg id=76>Could you please tell me your address.</seg>
<seg id=77>Do you have one in white?</seg>
<seg id=78>Where is the closest Mexican restaurant located?</seg>
<seg id=79>Could I have a look at that jacket that's in the window?</seg>
<seg id=80>No, let's do something else.</seg>
<seg id=81>Seems like it's going to rain.</seg>
<seg id=82>Do you want everything on that?</seg>
<seg id=83>What place are you calling from?</seg>
<seg id=84>Does Mr. Li know Japanese or English?</seg>
<seg id=85>Could you put a bit of a refresher on my lips?</seg>
<seg id=86>Would you want some other beverage?</seg>
<seg id=87>Afternoon.</seg>
<seg id=88>I'll go to find one that's a size larger.</seg>
<seg id=89>I'd like to cash in some traveler's checks.</seg>
<seg id=90>I'd like to have a room on the side with the mountains.</seg>
<seg id=91>Sure, I have it. This is it.</seg>
<seg id=92>I want some aspirin.</seg>
<seg id=93>A coffee afterwards, please.</seg>
<seg id=94>Do you have something on the light side?</seg>
<seg id=95>Could you tell me how to do it?</seg>
<seg id=96>See you in the morning.</seg>
<seg id=97>The next thing we need to decide is when, or how soon we should send someone to that city.</seg>
<seg id=98>There's something wrong with the clutch.</seg>
<seg id=99>My money has disappeared.</seg>
<seg id=100>Could I have another one, please.</seg>
<seg id=101>Do you have this style but in a different size?</seg>
<seg id=102>Where'd be the place to transfer?</seg>
<seg id=103>The phone line was cut off.</seg>
<seg id=104>That is super.</seg>
<seg id=105>OK, I'll get it to your right away.</seg>
<seg id=106>Where can I find the taxi stand?</seg>
<seg id=107>Are there food shops in this area?</seg>
<seg id=108>Absolutely.</seg>
<seg id=109>I'll be getting off when we get to the next stop.</seg>
<seg id=110>What time do the doors open?</seg>
<seg id=111>I'd like to have some indigestion medicine.</seg>
<seg id=112>I'll have what he's having.</seg>
<seg id=113>It'll only be the bridge fare of two dollars and fifty cents.</seg>
<seg id=114>Where would I find the closest bus stop?</seg>
<seg id=115>Do you want to drink some wine with your meal?</seg>
<seg id=116>He has taken my passport.</seg>
<seg id=117>You are moving in the wrong direction.</seg>
<seg id=118>It's going to be for six nights.</seg>
<seg id=119>I forgot and left my key in the room and locked myself out when I shut the door.</seg>
<seg id=120>It's personal.</seg>
<seg id=121>What are the well-known products from that town?</seg>
<seg id=122>Will this insurance policy be valid here?</seg>
<seg id=123>Do you serve vegetarian meals?</seg>
<seg id=124>Where would the nearest pharmacy be?</seg>
<seg id=125>The guitar is what I especially like.</seg>
<seg id=126>What kind of car were you looking for?</seg>
<seg id=127>Please leave the dressing off my salad.</seg>
<seg id=128>Does a parking space come as part of it?</seg>
<seg id=129>I want to have some raw oysters.</seg>
<seg id=130>Don't bother with the change.</seg>
<seg id=131>Could you explain how to get to the grocery store?</seg>
<seg id=132>The air-conditioning is broken.</seg>
<seg id=133>No, that is not imperative.</seg>
<seg id=134>My luggage isn't here.</seg>
<seg id=135>It's too much.</seg>
<seg id=136>May I have a receipt, please.</seg>
<seg id=137>I've got a terrible blister on my foot.</seg>
<seg id=138>You're welcome.</seg>
<seg id=139>It costs a bit too much.</seg>
<seg id=140>Do I have to have a reservation?</seg>
<seg id=141>Would I have to purchase tickets ahead of time?</seg>
<seg id=142>How much duty will I have to pay on this?</seg>
<seg id=143>Could I get a ticket for a seat in the infield?</seg>
<seg id=144>Where would there be a sightseeing bus?</seg>
<seg id=145>I beg your pardon. Would you be able to assist me?</seg>
<seg id=146>If it won't be an inconvenience.</seg>
<seg id=147>Would you open the window, please?</seg>
<seg id=148>I'll put it on my card.</seg>
<seg id=149>How long are we going to have to wait?</seg>
<seg id=150>Yes. I need a little change with that, if you could.</seg>
<seg id=151>It's too small.</seg>
<seg id=152>It's for the hors d'oeuvre.</seg>
<seg id=153>Have you got room service?</seg>
<seg id=154>Can I take an order for you?</seg>
<seg id=155>What do the tomatoes run?</seg>
<seg id=156>Wait just a moment, please. S. Nicholas' phone number is three six four five seven four one.</seg>
<seg id=157>Would there be a gift shop?</seg>
<seg id=158>Are there any city tour buses?</seg>
<seg id=159>Can I leave my coat with you, please?</seg>
<seg id=160>I don't know how to operate the heater.</seg>
<seg id=161>We still don't know what we want to order.</seg>
<seg id=162>OK. What will it be?</seg>
<seg id=163>I don't know about the size.</seg>
<seg id=164>Is there any medicine for motion sickness?</seg>
<seg id=165>I'm not acquainted with this dance.</seg>
<seg id=166>Is this car bound for Liverpool?</seg>
<seg id=167>How does this pump work?</seg>
<seg id=168>Is there anything in a lighter color?</seg>
<seg id=169>I've thrown up a lot.</seg>
<seg id=170>I have to get into LA between noon and two p.m.</seg>
<seg id=171>That's not what I meant.</seg>
<seg id=172>Sorry, it's already a full house.</seg>
<seg id=173>Would you have some medicine I could take for a stomachache?</seg>
<seg id=174>Could you take my luggage to my room?</seg>
<seg id=175>Please make my cheeseburger with everything but tomato.</seg>
<seg id=176>It's fine.</seg>
<seg id=177>Would there be any different tours?</seg>
<seg id=178>Did you want a cold drink with that?</seg>
<seg id=179>Yes, could you wait a moment while I put you on hold?</seg>
<seg id=180>Yeah, I get it.</seg>
<seg id=181>I lost a filling.</seg>
<seg id=182>In February, which is the coldest month, the temperature drops to minus thirty.</seg>
<seg id=183>There seems to be a problem with the calculation.</seg>
<seg id=184>It wasn't me that made this scratch.</seg>
<seg id=185>It's a clear day.</seg>
<seg id=186>What's the blue plate special? Could you please point to it on the menu?</seg>
<seg id=187>No, it's not necessary.</seg>
<seg id=188>I'd like to take a tour. What choices of tours have you got?</seg>
<seg id=189>I scraped my right palm.</seg>
<seg id=190>I'll have this and this. One medium cola, please.</seg>
<seg id=191>What about having lunch or something?</seg>
<seg id=192>Don't do anything that will kill me.</seg>
<seg id=193>If you go down this street about three blocks, you'll see it.</seg>
<seg id=194>Do you have anything open for ninety-nine people?</seg>
<seg id=195>Isn't there some cheaper way?</seg>
<seg id=196>Does it have a powerful current?</seg>
<seg id=197>What's the approximate waiting time?</seg>
<seg id=198>It's wonderful that you are feeling better.</seg>
<seg id=199>Would you please show us where our seats are?</seg>
<seg id=200>I've really done it now.</seg>
<seg id=201>That's how it is.</seg>
<seg id=202>Can I be refunded for this?</seg>
<seg id=203>May I have a prescription?</seg>
<seg id=204>I want to leave my valuable possessions in the safe, please.</seg>

<seg id=222>Could you repeat that please?</seg>
<seg id=223>How about having a beverage?</seg>
<seg id=224>About how much time does it take to get to Tucson?</seg>
<seg id=225>I was in an accident.</seg>
<seg id=226>Can I put the postage on my card, too?</seg>
<seg id=227>What is the cost per word?</seg>
<seg id=228>I just need a bit of a trim.</seg>
<seg id=229>Please get a taxi for me.</seg>
<seg id=230>Would you have any guidebooks for a trip to New York?</seg>
<seg id=231>I'd like to make a reconfirmation of my flight.</seg>

<seg id=234>Get out of the car, please.</seg>
<seg id=235>That's no problem.</seg>
<seg id=236>I don't have much time to spare.</seg>
<seg id=237>It will depart exactly at twelve noon.</seg>

<seg id=241>The lights are out.</seg>
<seg id=242>You will be boarding your flight at gate three.</seg>
<seg id=243>When can they be reissued?</seg>
<seg id=244>It's a gift for my dad.</seg>
<seg id=245>I'd like to go to Phantom of the Opera.</seg>
<seg id=246>Could you give me a hand with this luggage?</seg>
<seg id=247>There's been a mistake.</seg>
<seg id=248>Yes, that's true. What type of little gifts should I get as souvenirs for going back to Japan?</seg>
<seg id=249>Is there anything I can help you find?</seg>
<seg id=250>Where should I go if I want some chips?</seg>
<seg id=251>When will you be able to bring it?</seg>

<seg id=253>It sure is a big serving.</seg>
<seg id=254>Would you have some Japanese books?</seg>
<seg id=255>Mind if I see how they fit?</seg>
<seg id=256>This key doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id=257>Do you mind if I take your picture?</seg>
<seg id=258>How do you like your steak?</seg>
<seg id=259>I'd like to have a cut and a shave, please.</seg>
<seg id=260>May I have a look at your passport?</seg>

<seg id=266>Do you get it?</seg>
<seg id=267>Absolutely.</seg>
<seg id=268>Would you please send it over to my hotel?</seg>
<seg id=269>Can you do it so that it is just like this picture?</seg>
<seg id=270>Please escort me that far.</seg>
<seg id=271>May I have seconds on the green beans?</seg>

<seg id=275>When do your doors open?</seg>
<seg id=276>Will I be able to continue on my trip as scheduled?</seg>
<seg id=277>Is there a defect?</seg>

<seg id=282>That will be all right.</seg>
<seg id=283>I wear soft contacts.</seg>
<seg id=284>The name is Mari Mizuta. The first name is spelled M A R I and the last name is M I Z U T A.</seg>
<seg id=285>What gate number do I go to?</seg>
<seg id=286>It's wonderful to be with just you.</seg>
<seg id=287>May I take a look at the organization chart for the company?</seg>
<seg id=288>Is there anything I can give you assistance with?</seg>
<seg id=289>Is this the place to make a reservation?</seg>
<seg id=290>My shoes gave me blisters. Are there any band-aids?</seg>
<seg id=291>My skirt doesn't seem to be here.</seg>
<seg id=292>Well, let's try and see. So what's the exact place at Union Square that your friend will be waiting?</seg>
<seg id=293>I'll go with you to see the police.</seg>
<seg id=294>My English isn't at a level that I can follow it immediately. May I take it with me and come back again tomorrow?</seg>
<seg id=295>Please open up your bag.</seg>
<seg id=296>That's for what time?</seg>
<seg id=297>OK if I move to the front?</seg>
<seg id=298>I'm employed by a Japanese stock brokerage firm. I'm at the branch in New York.</seg>
<seg id=299>It's a doll, a Japanese doll.</seg>
<seg id=300>Since the economic conditions are so up and down, the project is quite a risk.</seg>
<seg id=301>As a matter of fact.</seg>
<seg id=302>Visiting the sights.</seg>
<seg id=303>My stomach seems to be having problems.</seg>
<seg id=304>My feet ache.</seg>
<seg id=305>Would you please take our dishes?</seg>
<seg id=306>No, I haven't made a decision yet.</seg>
<seg id=307>The gift-wrapping is on floor one.</seg>
<seg id=308>Where would lost and found be?</seg>
<seg id=309>Where can I go to ride a horse?</seg>
<seg id=310>You can have either A or B with that.</seg>

<seg id=314>I should have been aware of that.</seg>
<seg id=315>That's an incredible sight.</seg>
<seg id=316>Do you have this but in another color?</seg>
<seg id=317>I'm just dead.</seg>
<seg id=318>That's sixteen dollars. You'll want to take subway line six.</seg>
<seg id=319>It can't be done.</seg>
<seg id=320>Where could I rent a limo?</seg>
<seg id=321>What sorts of sodas are there?</seg>
<seg id=322>Please do.</seg>
<seg id=323>I don't really like this so much.</seg>
<seg id=324>Can you show me your student card?</seg>
<seg id=325>Sorry, can I get by?</seg>
<seg id=326>That's it.</seg>
<seg id=327>Should I just push this to get off?</seg>
<seg id=328>In hard cash. Since I'm giving you cash, please let me have it for three hundred dollars.</seg>
<seg id=329>That reservation has been reconfirmed.</seg>
<seg id=330>Could you bring some lemon for me?</seg>
<seg id=331>Yes, if you let me have a look at your passport.</seg>

<seg id=333>What time should we be here by to check in?</seg>
<seg id=334>Can I ask you something personal?</seg>
<seg id=335>Please don't concern yourself about it.</seg>
<seg id=336>No, that's fine.</seg>
<seg id=337>A sports car would be good.</seg>
<seg id=338>See you soon.</seg>
<seg id=339>Can you please tell me your name and room number?</seg>
<seg id=340>International operator.</seg>
<seg id=341>Please retain your receipt.</seg>

<seg id=344>How did that phone number go?</seg>
<seg id=345>Where would the baggage carts be?</seg>
<seg id=346>I'd like to book a seat.</seg>
<seg id=347>All thanks to you, I got there in time to catch the last train.</seg>
<seg id=348>Yes. The side, here, is torn.</seg>
<seg id=349>How long will it be?</seg>
<seg id=350>Could you please bring me the check.</seg>
<seg id=351>To get to Broadway by train, where do I transfer?</seg>

<seg id=353>Is there a police station in the vicinity?</seg>
<seg id=354>What's the best way to reconfirm my flight?</seg>
<seg id=355>Hi. Hiroshi Sato from Nippon Engineering. I'm scheduled to see Mr. Ebert at eleven o'clock.</seg>
<seg id=356>Take out, please.</seg>
<seg id=357>I wonder if I'll have any problem making my connection.</seg>
<seg id=358>This is room number one hundred twenty-three. Could we get some ice, please?</seg>
<seg id=359>At what time will we be getting to New York?</seg>
<seg id=360>Awesome.</seg>
<seg id=361>Can you alter this for me?</seg>
<seg id=362>Yeah. This is it.</seg>
<seg id=363>See you later this evening.</seg>
<seg id=364>Would you have any tickets for today?</seg>
<seg id=365>Fine, thanks. How're you doing?</seg>
<seg id=366>That's a nice feeling, isn't it?</seg>
<seg id=367>I'd like to book a flight.</seg>
<seg id=368>That is horrible.</seg>
<seg id=369>Can you get it there by tomorrow?</seg>
<seg id=370>I'll have what she's having.</seg>
<seg id=371>Don't mention it.</seg>
<seg id=372>By what time would you like the car back?</seg>
<seg id=373>Pardon me. Can you repeat what you said, please?</seg>
<seg id=374>It made my eyes open widely.</seg>
<seg id=375>Have you got plastic silverware?</seg>
<seg id=376>No, I'm the only one who'll be using it.</seg>

<seg id=380>Here are the check numbers.</seg>
<seg id=381>I won't be getting back until later tonight.</seg>
<seg id=382>I can't locate my bags.</seg>
<seg id=383>How would you like to go swimming?</seg>
<seg id=384>No one is picking up the phone.</seg>
<seg id=385>How long will it be before I can get a new one?</seg>
<seg id=386>What kind of eggs would you like?</seg>
<seg id=387>Please hand me the change.</seg>
<seg id=388>I want this one, please.</seg>
<seg id=389>Is it all right if I take a picture here?</seg>
<seg id=390>Could you talk a bit louder?</seg>
<seg id=391>English is a bit hard for me to understand.</seg>
<seg id=392>This is a nice style. What colors does it come in?</seg>
<seg id=393>Let me see some tinted lenses, please.</seg>
<seg id=394>Please take me to this place.</seg>
<seg id=395>I'd like to see some lipstick, please.</seg>
<seg id=396>Would you mind measuring my neck?</seg>
<seg id=397>I have frequent stomachaches.</seg>
<seg id=398>It's the wrong size.</seg>
<seg id=399>I don't have any interest in that.</seg>
<seg id=400>The toilet paper is gone.</seg>
<seg id=401>What difference is there between this one and that one?</seg>
<seg id=402>I'll let you have a prescription. Take it to a pharmacist.</seg>
<seg id=403>I'd like to get my valuables back that I left in your care.</seg>
<seg id=404>There's no limit on the mileage.</seg>
<seg id=405>They are a bit snug. Could I get some that run a little bigger? I want to check the fit of the same thing in another color.</seg>
<seg id=406>How much for everything?</seg>
<seg id=407>Evening.</seg>
<seg id=408>Here we have the receipt.</seg>
<seg id=409>Would you change this, please?</seg>
<seg id=410>What about these?</seg>
<seg id=411>That's the mountain called Bromo.</seg>
<seg id=412>What was that?</seg>
<seg id=413>Please give me a bourbon and water.</seg>
<seg id=414>Sorry, but would you be willing to just push here to take a picture of us?</seg>
<seg id=415>Would you prefer to have some coffee or some tea?</seg>
<seg id=416>I'll give you a ride to the airport.</seg>
<seg id=417>Sure thing.</seg>
<seg id=418>May I have one roll of the black and white?</seg>
<seg id=419>Would you have something along these lines but in a more muted color?</seg>
<seg id=420>Can I pay with this card, here?</seg>
<seg id=421>I forgot and left my passport in the taxi.</seg>
<seg id=422>Please don't speak so quickly.</seg>
<seg id=423>I want to take this on board with me.</seg>
<seg id=424>I'd like to have a meal.</seg>
<seg id=425>This food is fabulous.</seg>
<seg id=426>My chest is throbbing with pain.</seg>
<seg id=427>Who is the script writer?</seg>
<seg id=428>A compact would be my preference.</seg>
<seg id=429>This plane will be one hour late.</seg>
<seg id=430>Kind of.</seg>
<seg id=431>How long will we have to wait to get them reissued?</seg>
<seg id=432>How do you like your meat?</seg>
<seg id=433>Sure. But, we have nothing left until next Monday.</seg>
<seg id=434>I'll take a medium, please.</seg>
<seg id=435>I was witness to a hit and run.</seg>
<seg id=436>I want to book a flight to New York on the thirtieth of August.</seg>
<seg id=437>What's the cost per night?</seg>
<seg id=438>I'm feeling a bit chilly.</seg>
<seg id=439>Could you put me through to another room, please.</seg>
<seg id=440>Where do you want me to sign?</seg>
<seg id=441>I'd like a hotel in the vicinity of Hyde Park, please.</seg>
<seg id=442>Are reservations required for the dining car?</seg>
<seg id=443>This is the wrong size. Could I change it for another size?</seg>
<seg id=444>How much of a handicap do you have?</seg>
<seg id=445>He'll come for sure.</seg>
<seg id=446>This evening, I'd like to see an opera.</seg>
<seg id=447>A big room, please.</seg>
<seg id=448>Three Gs on the red, Jimmy.</seg>
<seg id=449>Those are tax-free.</seg>
<seg id=450>I got a bruise.</seg>
<seg id=451>I'll inoculate you.</seg>
<seg id=452>Could you bring us some more plates?</seg>
<seg id=453>Stop, thief.</seg>
<seg id=454>Is there a ticket seller nearby?</seg>
<seg id=455>No milk for me, please.</seg>
<seg id=456>There wasn't a thing that could be done about it.</seg>
<seg id=457>Do you serve Coke?</seg>
<seg id=458>That's the end of it?</seg>
<seg id=459>How did you find the museum, Eiko?</seg>
<seg id=460>You are not allowed to take photos in the airport.</seg>
<seg id=461>Please make it forty-two inches.</seg>
<seg id=462>Yeah, we still have a few.</seg>
<seg id=463>Just push this.</seg>
<seg id=464>How are things going at school?</seg>
<seg id=465>The bath isn't working properly.</seg>
<seg id=466>But, for miniature bottles, it's the number, not the volume that the tax is based on.</seg>
<seg id=467>As inexpensive a place as possible.</seg>
<seg id=468>I see.</seg>
<seg id=469>The name is Tanaka and I've made a reservation for tonight.</seg>
<seg id=470>I understand.</seg>
<seg id=471>Sure.</seg>
<seg id=472>I'm glad to do it.</seg>
<seg id=473>I got locked out when I forgot my key.</seg>
<seg id=474>I'd like it hard-boiled, please.</seg>
<seg id=475>It's too bad but I won't be able to.</seg>
<seg id=476>Where do you go for her clothes?</seg>
<seg id=477>What kind of soup do you have today?</seg>
<seg id=478>You have a small shot at getting on that flight.</seg>
<seg id=479>Would you have a reservation?</seg>
<seg id=480>Could I see a menu, please?</seg>
<seg id=481>Would you be able to get a babysitter for me?</seg>
<seg id=482>My stomach hurts.</seg>
<seg id=483>I need your address, please.</seg>
<seg id=484>Where might I be able to get a ticket?</seg>

<seg id=486>There you are.</seg>
<seg id=487>Are those sweet pretzels or salty ones?</seg>
<seg id=488>Do you have anything that will be fast?</seg>

<seg id=493>Thanks for your hard work.</seg>
<seg id=494>Can you have it ready by tomorrow morning?</seg>
<seg id=495>What is the arrival time in Liverpool?</seg>
<seg id=496>By all means.</seg>
<seg id=497>I want to visit A Company's factory.</seg>
<seg id=498>What does the all-day tour run?</seg>
<seg id=499>There's no one by the name of Suzuki here.</seg>

<seg id=507>What types of tours do you have?</seg>
</doc>
<doc docid="xxx" sysid="A7">
<seg id=1>Does that price cover dinner as well?</seg>
<seg id=2>Singing is what I do.</seg>
<seg id=3>What's the best way for me to get there?</seg>
<seg id=4>Please get the concierge.</seg>
<seg id=5>And this one?</seg>
<seg id=6>Just push this.</seg>
<seg id=7>I bought some medicine that didn't require a prescription.</seg>
<seg id=8>Can I ask you for another towel?</seg>
<seg id=9>This is not what I asked for.</seg>
<seg id=10>For business men and women in Japan, the more extensive their network, the better. If they do business with those whom they know through that network, or with people to whom they have been introduced, then their business will have a head start.</seg>
<seg id=11>I'd appreciate a pillow.</seg>
<seg id=12>I'm thinking of getting some souvenirs.</seg>
<seg id=13>What time will the train be pulling into Dover?</seg>
<seg id=14>Do you think there's a chance that I will experience seasickness?</seg>
<seg id=15>I have something I want to order, please.</seg>
<seg id=16>How's it going?</seg>
<seg id=17>I'm very interested in going to a play.</seg>
<seg id=18>How much time will we have to wait?</seg>
<seg id=19>I want to take off a day earlier.</seg>
<seg id=20>Wait a sec.</seg>
<seg id=21>Can you take this for me while I do some shopping?</seg>
<seg id=22>Oh, yeah. Will this be all right?</seg>
<seg id=23>That's unexpected.</seg>
<seg id=24>I'm going to tell the Better Business Bureau about this.</seg>
<seg id=25>I'm feeling sick.</seg>
<seg id=26>I'm unable to locate this building.</seg>
<seg id=27>Hello, excuse me.</seg>
<seg id=28>Is there a place for shopping?</seg>
<seg id=29>Please feel free to ask me any time.</seg>
<seg id=30>What do you think of this color on me?</seg>
<seg id=31>You can't be serious.</seg>
<seg id=32>There's nothing to be worried about. It's going to go very well.</seg>
<seg id=33>I'd just like olive oil and vinegar, please.</seg>
<seg id=34>That tie is good on you.</seg>
<seg id=35>Could you show me this one?</seg>
<seg id=36>Will that be a medium or a large?</seg>
<seg id=37>Are you finished with your meal?</seg>
<seg id=38>I'll give you a prescription and you can take it to a pharmacy to have it filled.</seg>
<seg id=39>Thank you, I really appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id=40>That would mean so much to me if you could.</seg>
<seg id=41>This one is the purchase agreement.</seg>
<seg id=42>How's this on me?</seg>
<seg id=43>Do you want insurance for the contents?</seg>
<seg id=44>Does that come with unlimited miles?</seg>
<seg id=45>Is there an emergency room nearby?</seg>
<seg id=46>It's OK. It's probably OK to pay in coins.</seg>
<seg id=47>I suggest a lighter or a tie.</seg>
<seg id=48>Do you have anything like this only two sizes smaller?</seg>
<seg id=49>Should I do them up in gift-wrap?</seg>
<seg id=50>May I take the trial diving lesson?</seg>
<seg id=51>I want to book a seat to Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id=52>Where's the nearest station?</seg>
<seg id=53>See you after while.</seg>
<seg id=54>Hmm?</seg>
<seg id=55>Do we have to have a reservation?</seg>
<seg id=56>If you compare this one and that one, what's the difference?</seg>
<seg id=57>Could you give me a deal?</seg>
<seg id=58>Can I stay on my trip?</seg>
<seg id=59>Yeah. There is one if you go across the street from the post office.</seg>
<seg id=60>I'd like to reserve a spot for two for dinner at seven.</seg>
<seg id=61>It's about five and a half hours more.</seg>
<seg id=62>What kind of thing would that be?</seg>
<seg id=63>Let's have a large, please.</seg>
<seg id=64>Did you want to send it airmail or surface mail?</seg>
<seg id=65>Could you repeat your name again?</seg>
<seg id=66>Nevertheless, it would be best if you didn't stray from the main streets because it's not safe.</seg>
<seg id=67>My friend's son is taking an entrance exam for admission to kindergarten.</seg>
<seg id=68>May I taste a little bite of the cheese just to see what it's like?</seg>
<seg id=69>Can this be returned?</seg>
<seg id=70>I'll have soup to start, please.</seg>
<seg id=71>Yes, well, if you don't mind my saying so, a one week cruise for eight hundred dollars won't be so extravagant. However, if you think a cabin with no view on the lower deck of a smaller ship is all right, then, there are a few things available.</seg>
<seg id=72>That's located on the fourth floor.</seg>
<seg id=73>We can't eat it all so we want a doggy bag.</seg>
<seg id=74>Oh, you've got a seat by the window. Come this way, please.</seg>
<seg id=75>How can I make the gas come out of the pump?</seg>
<seg id=76>Your address, please.</seg>
<seg id=77>Is there one in white?</seg>
<seg id=78>Where is the Mexican restaurant closest to here?</seg>
<seg id=79>May I take a look at the jacket in the window?</seg>
<seg id=80>No, let's stop with that.</seg>
<seg id=81>Appears that it's going to rain.</seg>
<seg id=82>Would you like me to put everything on that?</seg>
<seg id=83>What's the location you are calling from?</seg>
<seg id=84>Does Mr. Li understand Japanese or English?</seg>
<seg id=85>Can you even out my lipstick for me, please?</seg>
<seg id=86>How about some other kind of drink?</seg>
<seg id=87>How're you doing?</seg>
<seg id=88>I'll go and bring you back one that's a size larger.</seg>
<seg id=89>I want to exchange some traveler's checks for cash.</seg>
<seg id=90>I'd like to get a room on the side with the mountains.</seg>
<seg id=91>Right, I brought it. Here you go.</seg>
<seg id=92>I'd like something for the pain.</seg>
<seg id=93>A cup of coffee later, please.</seg>
<seg id=94>Would you have anything light?</seg>
<seg id=95>Can you give me an explanation as to how it works?</seg>
<seg id=96>Sweet dreams.</seg>
<seg id=97>The next matter we have to make a decision on is when, or rather, how soon we need to send a representative to that city.</seg>
<seg id=98>There's something the matter with the clutch.</seg>
<seg id=99>My money has vanished.</seg>
<seg id=100>Please give me one more.</seg>
<seg id=101>Have you got a different size for this style?</seg>
<seg id=102>Where do I get off and transfer?</seg>
<seg id=103>The line just cut off.</seg>
<seg id=104>That's fabulous.</seg>
<seg id=105>Fine, I'll bring it over immediately.</seg>
<seg id=106>Where can I catch a cab?</seg>
<seg id=107>Are there places to buy fresh food near here?</seg>
<seg id=108>Certainly.</seg>
<seg id=109>The next stop is mine.</seg>
<seg id=110>What time do you open for business?</seg>
<seg id=111>I need some medicine that will help my indigestion.</seg>
<seg id=112>I want what he ordered.</seg>
<seg id=113>That's just the toll for the bridge of two-fifty.</seg>
<seg id=114>Where is the bus stop closest to here?</seg>
<seg id=115>How about some wine with your food?</seg>
<seg id=116>He walked off with my passport.</seg>
<seg id=117>You are headed the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id=118>That'll be six nights.</seg>
<seg id=119>When I left the room, I forgot my key inside and the door locked.</seg>
<seg id=120>It doesn't concern you.</seg>
<seg id=121>What famous products does that town have?</seg>

<seg id=444>What would your handicap be?</seg>

<seg id=465>Something with the bath is broken.</seg>
<seg id=466>But, with miniature bottles, they use the number, not the volume as the basis for tax.</seg>
<seg id=467>As reasonable a place as you can.</seg>
<seg id=468>I understand.</seg>
<seg id=469>My name's Tanaka and I believe you have a reservation for me for tonight.</seg>
<seg id=470>I get it.</seg>

<seg id=1>Does the fee include dinner?</seg>
<seg id=2>I sing.</seg>
<seg id=3>How do you plan to get there?</seg>
<seg id=4>Please get a bellhop.</seg>
<seg id=5>What about this?</seg>
<seg id=6>All you do is press here.</seg>
<seg id=7>I purchased some over-the-counter medication.</seg>
<seg id=8>Bring me another towel, please.</seg>
<seg id=9>This isn't what I ordered.</seg>
<seg id=10>To do business in Japan, the larger a person's "Jinmayku," the better it is. When business is conducted within one's "Jinmayku" or through a connection, it is without a doubt an excellent starting point.</seg>
<seg id=11>I'd like a pillow.</seg>
<seg id=12>I plan to get some gifts.</seg>
<seg id=13>When will that train arrive in Dover?</seg>
<seg id=14>Will there be a possibility of me getting seasick?</seg>

<seg id=16>Hello.</seg>
<seg id=17>I want to go to a play.</seg>
<seg id=18>What is the approximate waiting time?</seg>
<seg id=19>I would like to go one day earlier.</seg>
<seg id=20>One moment, please.</seg>
<seg id=21>Do you mind looking after this while I go shopping?</seg>
<seg id=22>Oh, yah. How about this?</seg>
<seg id=23>That's some coincidence.</seg>
<seg id=24>I'll be reporting this to the Better Business Bureau.</seg>
<seg id=25>I'm not feeling well.</seg>
<seg id=26>I'm unable to find this building.</seg>
<seg id=27>Excuse me.</seg>
<seg id=28>Do you know of some place to go shopping?</seg>
<seg id=29>Ask me anytime.</seg>
<seg id=30>Do you think this color suits me?</seg>
<seg id=31>No way.</seg>
<seg id=32>No worries. It'll be just fine.</seg>
<seg id=33>Please just make it olive oil and vinegar.</seg>
<seg id=34>That tie looks good on you.</seg>
<seg id=35>Would you show me this one?</seg>
<seg id=36>Would you like a medium or large?</seg>
<seg id=37>Are you finished your dinner?</seg>
<seg id=38>Have the prescription I write for you filled at the drugstore.</seg>
<seg id=39>Thanks.</seg>
<seg id=40>I'd really be appreciative if you could that.</seg>
<seg id=41>This is the purchase agreement.</seg>
<seg id=42>Does it suit me?</seg>
<seg id=43>Will you insure the contents?</seg>
<seg id=44>Is it unlimited mileage?</seg>
<seg id=45>Is an emergency hospital located in this area?</seg>
<seg id=46>All right. I should be able to pay you in coins.</seg>

<seg id=48>Is there one available that's two sizes smaller?</seg>
<seg id=49>Do you want this gift-wrapped?</seg>
<seg id=50>Is there an introductory diving course?</seg>
<seg id=51>I'd like to book a flight to Tokyo.</seg>
<seg id=52>Where would the nearest station be?</seg>
<seg id=53>Let's get together again.</seg>
<seg id=54>Pardon me?</seg>
<seg id=55>Are reservations required?</seg>
<seg id=56>How is this different from the other one?</seg>
<seg id=57>Can I get a discount?</seg>
<seg id=58>Do you think I can continue my trip?</seg>
<seg id=59>Right. Across the street from the post office.</seg>
<seg id=60>Could I make reservations for two for tonight at seven?</seg>
<seg id=61>It'll be another five and a half hours.</seg>
<seg id=62>What is that?</seg>
<seg id=63>Could you make it a large, please?</seg>
<seg id=64>Will that be airmail or surface mail?</seg>
<seg id=65>Your name again, please.</seg>
<seg id=66>However, I'd advise you to stay on the main streets. It could be dangerous.</seg>
<seg id=67>The son of a friend of mine will be taking an entrance exam for a kindergarten.</seg>
<seg id=68>Could I try just a bit of that cheese to taste it?</seg>
<seg id=69>Is it possible to return this?</seg>
<seg id=70>I'd like the soup first.</seg>
<seg id=71>I see. To be honest, an eight hundred dollar budget for a week's cruise isn't exactly extravagant. But, I have a two or three options for you if you don't mind taking a smaller boat, and staying in a cabin with no view.</seg>
<seg id=72>On the fourth floor.</seg>
<seg id=73>It's too much to finish, so could we take it home?</seg>
<seg id=74>I see, it's a seat by the window. Over on this side, please.</seg>
<seg id=75>How is the pump turned on?</seg>
<seg id=76>Would you give me your address?</seg>
<seg id=77>Is there one in white?</seg>
<seg id=78>Where can I find the nearest Mexican restaurant?</seg>
<seg id=79>Do you mind showing me the jacket in the window?</seg>
<seg id=80>Let's forget about it.</seg>
<seg id=81>It feels like we're going to have rain.</seg>
<seg id=82>Shall I put everything on it?</seg>
<seg id=83>Whereabouts are you placing this call from?</seg>
<seg id=84>Is Mr. Lee able to speak in Japanese or English?</seg>
<seg id=85>Would you fix my lipstick, please?</seg>
<seg id=86>How about another drink?</seg>
<seg id=87>Hi there.</seg>
<seg id=88>Can I bring you a size larger?</seg>
<seg id=89>I would like to cash some traveler's checks.</seg>
<seg id=90>I was hoping for a mountain side room.</seg>
<seg id=91>Yes, I have one. This is it.</seg>
<seg id=92>Could I have some painkilling medicine?</seg>
<seg id=93>I'd also like a coffee later, please.</seg>
<seg id=94>Is there anything light?</seg>
<seg id=95>Would you show me how it's done?</seg>
<seg id=96>Sweet dreams.</seg>
<seg id=97>For the next item, we need to focus on how quickly, rather than when, we should dispatch a rep to that city.</seg>
<seg id=98>The clutch doesn't work.</seg>
<seg id=99>I lost some money.</seg>
<seg id=100>Can I have one more, please?</seg>
<seg id=101>Is this style available in another size?</seg>
<seg id=102>Where's the best place to transfer?</seg>
<seg id=103>The line has been cut off.</seg>
<seg id=104>That's amazing.</seg>
<seg id=105>Okay, I'll get one to you, right away.</seg>
<seg id=106>Where do I take a taxi?</seg>
<seg id=107>Would there be a market in this area?</seg>
<seg id=108>Of course.</seg>
<seg id=109>I want to get off at the next stop.</seg>
<seg id=110>What time do you open?</seg>
<seg id=111>I'd like some medication for indigestion.</seg>
<seg id=112>I want what he's having.</seg>
<seg id=113>There's only the bridge toll and it's two dollars and fifty cents.</seg>
<seg id=114>Could you tell me where the nearest bus stop is?</seg>
<seg id=115>Would you like to order some wine with your meal?</seg>
<seg id=116>He stole my passport.</seg>
<seg id=117>You're heading in the wrong direction.</seg>
<seg id=118>Six nights.</seg>
<seg id=119>I left my key in my room and locked myself out.</seg>
<seg id=120>Thanks a LOT.</seg>
<seg id=121>What items is that town best-known for?</seg>
<seg id=122>Will this insurance policy cover this?</seg>
<seg id=123>Have you any vegetarian dishes?</seg>
<seg id=124>Where would the nearest drugstore be?</seg>
<seg id=125>More than anything, I enjoy the guitar.</seg>
<seg id=126>What is the model you are looking for?</seg>
<seg id=127>I'd prefer no dressing on the salad.</seg>
<seg id=128>Does the apartment come with a parking space?</seg>
<seg id=129>I want to eat some fresh oysters.</seg>
<seg id=130>You don't have to give me the change.</seg>
<seg id=131>How do I get to the supermarket?</seg>
<seg id=132>The air-conditioner is on the blitz.</seg>
<seg id=133>No, I don't think that's necessary.</seg>
<seg id=134>I can't find my bags.</seg>
<seg id=135>That's way to pricey.</seg>
<seg id=136>Please give me a receipt.</seg>
<seg id=137>There's a bad blister on my foot.</seg>
<seg id=138>My pleasure.</seg>
<seg id=139>It seems a bit too pricey.</seg>
<seg id=140>Is a reservation necessary?</seg>
<seg id=141>Must I book the tickets in advance?</seg>
<seg id=142>How much duty would go on this?</seg>
<seg id=143>Please give me a seat in the infield?</seg>
<seg id=144>From where would I take a sightseeing bus?</seg>
<seg id=145>Pardon me. Do you mind giving me a hand?</seg>
<seg id=146>If it doesn't put you out.</seg>
<seg id=147>Could you open a window, please?</seg>
<seg id=148>I'll be paying by credit card.</seg>
<seg id=149>How long is the wait?</seg>
<seg id=150>Yes. Could you include some small change?</seg>
<seg id=151>It's too snug.</seg>
<seg id=152>That's for the appetizer.</seg>
<seg id=153>Is room service offered?</seg>
<seg id=154>Would you like to order?</seg>
<seg id=155>How much do tomatoes cost?</seg>

<seg id=158>Do you know of any city sightseeing buses?</seg>
<seg id=159>Would you take my coat, please?</seg>
<seg id=160>I'm not sure how the heater works.</seg>
<seg id=161>We haven't decided what we want yet.</seg>
<seg id=162>Yes, what may I do for you?</seg>
<seg id=163>I'm not sure of the size.</seg>
<seg id=164>Have you anything for motion sickness?</seg>
<seg id=165>This dance isn't so familiar to me.</seg>
<seg id=166>Will this car be going to Liverpool?</seg>
<seg id=167>Would you show me how to use this fuel pump?</seg>
<seg id=168>Does it come in a lighter color?</seg>
<seg id=169>I threw up several times.</seg>
<seg id=170>I'm hoping to get into Los Angeles between noon and two.</seg>
<seg id=171>It's not what I meant.</seg>
<seg id=172>I'm sorry, but it's completely sold out.</seg>

<seg id=178>How about something like a cold drink with that?</seg>
<seg id=179>Yes, could you hold for a second?</seg>
<seg id=180>Yes, I understand.</seg>
<seg id=181>I've lost a filling.</seg>
<seg id=182>In the coldest month of February, it gets as cold as minus thirty.</seg>
<seg id=183>There's a calculation error on this bill.</seg>
<seg id=184>I'm not the one who scratched this.</seg>

<seg id=186>What is today's special? Where is it on the menu?</seg>
<seg id=187>No, I don't.</seg>
<seg id=188>I want to join a tour. What sorts of tours are available?</seg>
<seg id=189>I've scratched my right palm.</seg>
<seg id=190>This one and this one. I'd like a medium Coke, please.</seg>
<seg id=191>Shall we order lunch or something?</seg>
<seg id=192>Please don't take my life.</seg>
<seg id=193>You'll find it about three blocks down this street.</seg>

<seg id=317>I feel exhausted.</seg>
<seg id=318>It's sixteen dollars. Take the subway from track number six.</seg>

<seg id=320>Where would I be able to get a limousine?</seg>

<seg id=345>Where are the luggage carts kept?</seg>
<seg id=346>I want to make seating reservations, please.</seg>
<seg id=347>Thanks to you, I made the last train.</seg>

<seg id=358>Could you bring some ice to room one twenty-three?</seg>
<seg id=359>When will we arrive in New York?</seg>
<seg id=360>Exquisite.</seg>
<seg id=361>Could you adjust the size?</seg>
<seg id=362>Yes. This is it.</seg>
<seg id=363>Let's meet again tonight.</seg>
<seg id=364>Are tickets being sold at the door?</seg>
<seg id=365>Yes, good thanks. How about you?</seg>
<seg id=366>It's so nice to the touch.</seg>

<seg id=370>Can you give me the same?</seg>
<seg id=371>My pleasure.</seg>
<seg id=372>When should I return my vehicle by?</seg>
<seg id=373>Sorry. Would you mind repeating it, again?</seg>
<seg id=374>It completely opened my eyes.</seg>
<seg id=375>Have you any plastic forks and knives?</seg>
<seg id=376>No, it's my personal belonging.</seg>

<seg id=389>Is it all right to take a picture here?</seg>
<seg id=390>Would you mind raising your voice a little louder, please?</seg>
<seg id=391>I'm not so fluent in English.</seg>
<seg id=392>I'm interested in this style, but what colors does it come in?</seg>

<seg id=427>Who's the screenwriter?</seg>
<seg id=428>I'm looking for a compact car.</seg>

<seg id=8>I'd like one more towel, please.</seg>
<seg id=9>I didn't ask for this.</seg>
<seg id=10>It is more advantageous for businesspeople in Japan to have a wider "Jinmyaku". Conducting business within one's "Jinmyaku" or through a contact is always a very solid beginning.</seg>

<seg id=28>Where's a place I can go shopping?</seg>
<seg id=29>Feel free to ask whenever.</seg>
<seg id=30>Would you say this color looks good on me?</seg>
<seg id=31>No kidding.</seg>
<seg id=32>Don't you worry. Everything will work out fine.</seg>
<seg id=33>I'll just have olive oil and vinegar, please.</seg>
<seg id=34>You look good in that tie.</seg>

<seg id=68>Would it be possible to taste a bit of that cheese?</seg>
<seg id=69>Do you accept returns?</seg>
<seg id=70>I want the soup to start.</seg>
<seg id=71>Hmm. I hope I don't offend you but, eight hundred dollars in terms of a week's cruise won't get you luxury. However, there are a few options for you if you are okay staying in a cabin with no ocean view on a smaller boat.</seg>
<seg id=72>That's on the fourth floor.</seg>
<seg id=73>It's more than we can eat, so could we get it to go?</seg>

<seg id=97>The next item is to decide not so much when, but how quickly, we might send a rep to that city.</seg>
<seg id=98>The clutch isn't functioning properly.</seg>
<seg id=99>I seem to have lost my money.</seg>
<seg id=100>Give me one more, please.</seg>
<seg id=101>Are there other sizes available in this style?</seg>
<seg id=102>Can you tell me where to transfer?</seg>
<seg id=103>The phone has gone dead.</seg>

<seg id=106>Where's the taxi stand?</seg>

<seg id=110>When is your opening time?</seg>
<seg id=111>Could you give me some medication for indigestion?</seg>
<seg id=112>I'd like to order what he's getting.</seg>
<seg id=113>All there is the two dollar and fifty cent bridge toll.</seg>
<seg id=114>Which way to the closest bus stop?</seg>
<seg id=115>Will you be having wine with your meal?</seg>
<seg id=116>He snatched my passport.</seg>
<seg id=117>You are going the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id=118>A six night stay.</seg>
<seg id=119>I've locked myself out, with my key left in my room.</seg>

<seg id=133>No, that shouldn't be necessary.</seg>
<seg id=134>My bags are no where.</seg>
<seg id=135>That's overpriced.</seg>
<seg id=136>Could you give me a receipt, please?</seg>
<seg id=137>I have a terrible blister on my foot.</seg>
<seg id=138>No problem.</seg>
<seg id=139>The price is too high.</seg>
<seg id=140>Do you require reservations?</seg>
<seg id=141>Am I required to get tickets in advance?</seg>
<seg id=142>What's the duty on this?</seg>
<seg id=143>One seat in the infield, please.</seg>
<seg id=144>Where do sightseeing buses run from?</seg>
<seg id=145>I'm sorry. Could I bother you to help me?</seg>

<seg id=288>How may I help you?</seg>
<seg id=289>Would I be able to make reservations here?</seg>
<seg id=290>I've got blisters on my feet. Can I have a Band-Aid?</seg>
<seg id=291>My skirt has gone.</seg>
<seg id=292>Okay, let's try. Could you give me the exact location in Union Square that your friend is waiting?</seg>
<seg id=293>I could go to the police station with you.</seg>
<seg id=294>My English ability isn't good enough to understand it all right here. Do you mind if I take it home and come and see you again tomorrow?</seg>

<seg id=297>Is it open up front?</seg>
<seg id=298>I work for a securities company based in Japan. I'm at their New York branch.</seg>
<seg id=299>A Japanese doll.</seg>
<seg id=300>That's a risky project as economic circumstances are highly changeable.</seg>
<seg id=301>Actually.</seg>
<seg id=302>To sightsee.</seg>
<seg id=303>It seems as though I'm having stomach problems.</seg>
<seg id=304>My feet are hurting.</seg>
<seg id=305>Could the table be cleared?</seg>
<seg id=306>I still can't decide.</seg>

<seg id=315>That's just breathtaking.</seg>
<seg id=316>Can I get this in other colors?</seg>
<seg id=317>I'm totally beat.</seg>
<seg id=318>It costs sixteen dollars. You should take the subway from track number six.</seg>
<seg id=319>That's too much.</seg>
<seg id=320>Where could I arrange for a limousine?</seg>
<seg id=321>What kinds of sodas are available?</seg>
<seg id=322>Of course.</seg>
<seg id=323>This isn't really my taste.</seg>
<seg id=324>Could you present your student ID, please?</seg>
<seg id=325>Sorry, could I pass through?</seg>
<seg id=326>That's exactly it.</seg>
<seg id=327>When I want to get off, is this what I should press?</seg>
<seg id=328>It'll be cash. Since I'm paying in cash, how about making it three hundred?</seg>
<seg id=329>Your reservation has been reconfirmed.</seg>
<seg id=330>Could I get some lemon?</seg>
<seg id=331>You may. Could you just show me your passport, please?</seg>

<seg id=344>What would be the telephone number?</seg>
<seg id=345>Can you tell me where luggage carts are?</seg>

<seg id=361>May I have alterations made to this?</seg>
<seg id=362>Yes. This would be it.</seg>
<seg id=363>I'll be seeing you tonight.</seg>
<seg id=364>Can same-day tickets be purchased?</seg>
<seg id=365>Yes, fine thank you. How are you doing?</seg>
<seg id=366>What a nice texture.</seg>
<seg id=367>Could I reserve a flight?</seg>
<seg id=368>How horrific.</seg>
<seg id=369>Would you be able to deliver it by tomorrow?</seg>
<seg id=370>I'd like the same thing.</seg>
<seg id=371>No problem.</seg>
<seg id=372>By when does my vehicle need to be returned?</seg>
<seg id=373>Excuse me. I'd like you to repeat that, please.</seg>

<seg id=389>Am I allowed to take pictures here?</seg>
<seg id=390>May I ask you to speak a little louder, please?</seg>

<seg id=394>Could you take me here, please?</seg>
<seg id=395>I'd like to see some lipstick, please.</seg>

<seg id=397>I struggle with chronic stomach problems.</seg>
<seg id=398>It fits funny.</seg>
<seg id=399>It doesn't interest me.</seg>
<seg id=400>The toilet paper is out.</seg>
<seg id=401>What would be the difference between these two?</seg>
<seg id=402>I'll write a prescription for you. Bring it to a drugstore.</seg>
<seg id=403>Please give me my valuables that you're keeping for me.</seg>
<seg id=404>There is no limit on mileage.</seg>
<seg id=405>They're kind of snug. I'd like to try a slightly bigger size. Could I try on this same style in a different color?</seg>
<seg id=406>How much will that be all together?</seg>
<seg id=407>Hello.</seg>
<seg id=408>I've got the receipt here.</seg>

<seg id=419>Does this style come in a less flashy color?</seg>
<seg id=420>Is it possible to use this card here?</seg>
<seg id=421>I left my passport behind in the cab.</seg>
<seg id=422>Could you speak slowly, please?</seg>
<seg id=423>This is carry-on.</seg>
<seg id=424>I want to get something to eat.</seg>
<seg id=425>I'm really enjoying this food.</seg>
<seg id=426>My chest is throbbing.</seg>
<seg id=427>Do you know who wrote the script?</seg>
<seg id=428>I'm interested in getting a compact car.</seg>
<seg id=429>The flight is one hour late.</seg>
<seg id=430>Not so great.</seg>
<seg id=431>What length of time are we looking at to have them reissued?</seg>

<seg id=462>Yes, a few are still remaining.</seg>
<seg id=463>You just have to push here.</seg>

<seg id=465>The bath does not work.</seg>
<seg id=466>But, the duty on miniature bottles is calculated by volume, not number.</seg>
<seg id=467>As much as possible, somewhere inexpensive.</seg>
<seg id=468>Got it.</seg>
<seg id=469>There should be reservations under my name, Tanaka.</seg>

<seg id=26>This building is just no where.</seg>
<seg id=27>Is there anybody here?</seg>
<seg id=28>Is there somewhere I can go shopping?</seg>
<seg id=29>You can ask me anytime.</seg>
<seg id=30>Is this a color that suits me?</seg>
<seg id=31>That can't be.</seg>
<seg id=32>Don't worry about it. It'll work out in the end.</seg>

<seg id=69>Would I be able to return this?</seg>

<seg id=72>You'll find it on the fourth floor.</seg>
<seg id=73>We'd like to get it to go because we can't finish it.</seg>

<seg id=84>Does Mr. Lee speak in Japanese or English?</seg>
<seg id=85>Could I get you to fix my lipstick, please?</seg>

<seg id=99>I've dropped my money.</seg>
<seg id=100>I'd like one more, please.</seg>
<seg id=101>Does this style come in other sizes?</seg>
<seg id=102>Where am I supposed to transfer?</seg>
<seg id=103>Our call has been cut off.</seg>
<seg id=104>That's super.</seg>
<seg id=105>I see, it'll be here in a second.</seg>
<seg id=106>Which way to the taxi stand?</seg>
<seg id=107>Do you know of a market in this area?</seg>
<seg id=108>No doubt.</seg>
<seg id=109>Next stop is my stop.</seg>
<seg id=110>When will you open?</seg>
<seg id=111>Please give me some medicine for indigestion.</seg>
<seg id=112>I'll make it the same as him.</seg>
<seg id=113>There's just the two dollar and fifty cent bridge toll charge.</seg>
<seg id=114>What's the nearest bus stop?</seg>
<seg id=115>How about some wine with your meal?</seg>
<seg id=116>He lifted my passport.</seg>
<seg id=117>You're going opposite traffic.</seg>
<seg id=118>It'll be for six nights.</seg>
<seg id=119>Forgetting my key in my room, I locked myself out.</seg>

<seg id=132>The air-conditioner will not work.</seg>
<seg id=133>No, you shouldn't need to do that.</seg>
<seg id=134>I'm unable to locate my luggage.</seg>
<seg id=135>You're charging too much.</seg>
<seg id=136>May I have a receipt, please?</seg>
<seg id=137>A terrible blister has developed on my foot.</seg>
<seg id=138>Any time.</seg>
<seg id=139>I think you're asking too much.</seg>
<seg id=140>Must I have reservations?</seg>
<seg id=141>Is it necessary to purchase advance tickets?</seg>
<seg id=142>What amount of duty do I have to pay on this?</seg>
<seg id=143>I'd like a seat in the infield section, please.</seg>
<seg id=144>Where could I catch a sightseeing bus?</seg>
<seg id=145>Sorry to bother you. Could you lend me a hand?</seg>

<seg id=149>How long are we going to have to wait?</seg>
<seg id=150>Yeah. I'd like to have some small change, too.</seg>

<seg id=154>What would you like?</seg>
<seg id=155>What do your tomatoes cost?</seg>

<seg id=157>Where can I find a gift shop?</seg>
<seg id=158>Is a city sightseeing bus service offered?</seg>
<seg id=159>Could I check in my coat, please?</seg>
<seg id=160>How the heater works is a mystery to me.</seg>
<seg id=161>We're still thinking about what we want.</seg>
<seg id=162>Okay, what can I do?</seg>
<seg id=163>I don't know the size.</seg>
<seg id=164>Could I get some medication for motion sickness?</seg>

<seg id=71>Okay. If I may say so, eight hundred dollars for a week's cruise isn't so luxurious. However, if a back cabin with no sea-view on a smaller boat is to your satisfaction, there are a few possibilities.</seg>
<seg id=72>On the fourth floor.</seg>
<seg id=73>Since we can't finish it, we want to take it home.</seg>

<seg id=462>Sure, there are a few left.</seg>
<seg id=463>You just need to press this.</seg>
<seg id=464>How's school going?</seg>
<seg id=465>The bath is broken.</seg>
<seg id=466>But tax for miniature bottles is based on volume, not the number.</seg>
<seg id=467>The cheapest place possible.</seg>
<seg id=468>I see.</seg>

<seg id=476>Where do you go to buy her clothes?</seg>
<seg id=477>What's the soup of the day?</seg>

<seg id=4>I'd like you to call me a bellboy.</seg>
<seg id=5>What about getting this one?</seg>
<seg id=6>Just push this.</seg>
<seg id=7>I got myself an over-the-counter medicine.</seg>
<seg id=8>Get me one more towel.</seg>
<seg id=9>This isn't what I ordered.</seg>
<seg id=10>For businessmen in Japan, the more extensive their network of contacts the better. When he's working within his personal network or is introduced by someone, he'll have a successful start.</seg>

<seg id=19>I want to be off one day earlier.</seg>
<seg id=20>Hang on a moment.</seg>
<seg id=21>Could you look after this while I do some shopping?</seg>
<seg id=22>Oh, I see. Are you okay with this?</seg>
<seg id=23>It's just a coincidence.</seg>
<seg id=24>I'll report you to the Better Business Bureau.</seg>
<seg id=25>I feel ill.</seg>
<seg id=26>I've lost this building.</seg>
<seg id=27>Is there anyone in?</seg>
<seg id=28>Is there a place for shopping?</seg>
<seg id=29>Don't hesitate to ask me.</seg>
<seg id=30>Do I look good in this color?</seg>
<seg id=31>That's incredible.</seg>
<seg id=32>Don't worry. It'll definitely go well.</seg>
<seg id=33>Just use olive oil and vinegar.</seg>
<seg id=34>You look really good in that tie.</seg>
<seg id=35>Could you show me this one?</seg>
<seg id=36>Will that be medium or large?</seg>
<seg id=37>Are you done with your meal?</seg>
<seg id=38>I'm going to hand you a prescription, so fill it in when you get to the pharmacy.</seg>
<seg id=39>I really appreciate it.</seg>
<seg id=40>I'd be grateful if you would.</seg>
<seg id=41>This is the purchase agreement.</seg>
<seg id=42>Does it suit me?</seg>
<seg id=43>Shall I have the contents insured for you?</seg>
<seg id=44>Is that with unlimited mileage?</seg>
<seg id=45>Would there happen to be an emergency hospital nearby?</seg>

<seg id=53>I'll see you again sometime.</seg>
<seg id=54>Sorry?</seg>
<seg id=55>Is a reservation necessary?</seg>
<seg id=56>In what way does this one differ to that one?</seg>
<seg id=57>Can you lower the price?</seg>
<seg id=58>Is it okay for me to carry on traveling?</seg>
<seg id=59>Yes. There's one over the road from the post office.</seg>
<seg id=60>Can I reserve a table for two at seven tonight?</seg>

<seg id=64>Do you want this sent airmail or surface mail?</seg>
<seg id=65>I'd like to have your name again.</seg>
<seg id=66>But you'd better not stray off the main street because it's dangerous.</seg>
<seg id=67>My friend's son is going to sit a kindergarten entrance exam.</seg>
<seg id=68>I'd like to taste a little of the cheese, if possible.</seg>
<seg id=69>Can I bring this back?</seg>
<seg id=70>I want soup as a starter.</seg>
<seg id=71>Alright. If you don't mind me saying so, eight hundred dollars for a one week cruise isn't so extravagant. However, if you are satisfied with a back cabin where you can't see the sea on a smaller boat, we have a few possibilities.</seg>
<seg id=72>You'll find it on the fourth floor.</seg>
<seg id=73>We're full, so can we take it home?</seg>
<seg id=74>Well, your seat is on the window side. You need to head this way.</seg>
<seg id=75>Please show me how to start this pump.</seg>
<seg id=76>Could I have your address?</seg>
<seg id=77>Have you any white ones?</seg>
<seg id=78>The closest Mexican restaurant, please.</seg>
<seg id=79>Can you show me the jacket in the window?</seg>
<seg id=80>Let's give it up.</seg>
<seg id=81>It looks like it might rain.</seg>
<seg id=82>Do you want all the toppings?</seg>
<seg id=83>From where are you calling?</seg>
<seg id=84>Does Mr. Lee have Japanese or English speaking ability?</seg>
<seg id=85>Touch up my lips, please.</seg>
<seg id=86>How about another drink?</seg>
<seg id=87>Hello there.</seg>
<seg id=88>I'll go and get one a size bigger.</seg>
<seg id=89>I want to convert some traveler's checks into cash.</seg>
<seg id=90>I'd like to have a room on the side of the mountain.</seg>
<seg id=91>Yes, I've got it. Here you are.</seg>
<seg id=92>I want some painkillers.</seg>
<seg id=93>I'd like coffee later.</seg>
<seg id=94>Would you happen to have something light?</seg>
<seg id=95>I want you to tell me how.</seg>
<seg id=96>Have a good sleep.</seg>
<seg id=97>The next thing to decide is when, or rather how early, we need to send our representative to that city.</seg>
<seg id=98>There's something wrong with the clutch.</seg>
<seg id=99>My money's gone.</seg>
<seg id=100>I'd like to have one more.</seg>
<seg id=101>Have you got this in style in a different size?</seg>
<seg id=102>Where's the best place to transfer?</seg>
<seg id=103>The phone's gone dead.</seg>
<seg id=104>What a wonderful thing.</seg>
<seg id=105>Fine, I'll just go get it for you now.</seg>
<seg id=106>Where's the taxi stand?</seg>
<seg id=107>Could you tell me if there's a market nearby?</seg>
<seg id=108>Definitely.</seg>
<seg id=109>The next stop is mine.</seg>
<seg id=110>At what time do you open?</seg>
<seg id=111>Indigestion medicine, please.</seg>
<seg id=112>Get me the same thing he has.</seg>
<seg id=113>It's only two dollars fifty for the bridge toll.</seg>
<seg id=114>Where can I find the nearest bus stop?</seg>
<seg id=115>Wine with your meal, sir?</seg>
<seg id=116>He took away my passport.</seg>
<seg id=117>You're going the wrong way.</seg>
<seg id=118>Just six nights.</seg>
<seg id=119>I've shut the keys inside.</seg>
<seg id=120>It's none of your business.</seg>
<seg id=121>What products make it famous?</seg>
<seg id=122>Would it be okay to use this insurance policy?</seg>
<seg id=123>Do you serve vegetarian food?</seg>

<seg id=130>I'd like you to keep the change.</seg>
<seg id=131>I'd like you to show me how to get to the supermarket.</seg>
<seg id=132>Something's wrong with the air-conditioning.</seg>
<seg id=133>No, there's no need for that.</seg>
<seg id=134>I can't find my bags.</seg>
<seg id=135>Too dear.</seg>
<seg id=136>Could I have a receipt?</seg>
<seg id=137>There's a really bad blister on my foot.</seg>
<seg id=138>No problem.</seg>
<seg id=139>It's slightly too expensive.</seg>
<seg id=140>Is it necessary to make a reservation?</seg>
<seg id=141>Do I need to book advance tickets?</seg>
<seg id=142>How much is this taxed for?</seg>
<seg id=143>One infield ticket, please.</seg>
<seg id=144>Could you tell me where I can get a sightseeing bus?</seg>
<seg id=145>I'm sorry, but could you help me, please?</seg>
<seg id=146>If you really don't mind.</seg>
<seg id=147>Could you open the window?</seg>
<seg id=148>I'll use my credit card to pay.</seg>
<seg id=149>How long is the wait?</seg>
<seg id=150>Okay. Include some change, please.</seg>
<seg id=151>It's too tight-fitting.</seg>
<seg id=152>It's the cost of the appetizer.</seg>
<seg id=153>Have you got room service?</seg>
<seg id=154>What will it be then?</seg>
<seg id=155>What do the tomatoes cost?</seg>

<seg id=158>Would there be an inner city sightseeing bus?</seg>
<seg id=159>I'd like you to take care of my coat.</seg>
<seg id=160>I don't really understand how to use the heater.</seg>
<seg id=161>We haven't decided what we're going to order yet.</seg>
<seg id=162>Yes. What can I get for you?</seg>
<seg id=163>I'm not sure of the size.</seg>
<seg id=164>Would you happen to have any motion sickness pills?</seg>
<seg id=165>I'm not used to this dance.</seg>
<seg id=166>Is this car heading for Liverpool?</seg>
<seg id=167>Please show me how to use this pump.</seg>
<seg id=168>Any lighter colors?</seg>
<seg id=169>I threw up several times.</seg>
<seg id=170>I wish to reach Los Angeles between twelve and two.</seg>
<seg id=171>I didn't say it with that kind of meaning.</seg>

<seg id=179>Right, please hold.</seg>
<seg id=180>Ah, I understand.</seg>
<seg id=181>My filling dropped out.</seg>
<seg id=182>It gets down to minus thirty degrees in February, the coldest time.</seg>
<seg id=183>There's a mistake on the bill.</seg>
<seg id=184>It wasn't me who scratched it.</seg>
<seg id=185>What nice weather it is today.</seg>
<seg id=186>Could you tell me what today's special is? Show me where it is on the menu.</seg>
<seg id=187>I don't want any, thanks.</seg>
<seg id=188>I want to take part in a tour. What kind of tours have you got?</seg>
<seg id=189>There's a graze on the palm of my right hand.</seg>
<seg id=190>I'll have this and this. I'll have a medium Coke.</seg>
<seg id=191>What about having some lunch?</seg>
<seg id=192>Spare me.</seg>
<seg id=193>It's located some three blocks down this street.</seg>

<seg id=198>It's wonderful to see you feeling better.</seg>
<seg id=199>Escort us to our seats.</seg>
<seg id=200>Something's gone wrong.</seg>
<seg id=201>It's that one.</seg>
<seg id=202>May I have this refunded?</seg>
<seg id=203>A prescription, please.</seg>
<seg id=204>I'd like you to keep my valuables in the safe.</seg>

<seg id=422>Talk slowly, please.</seg>
<seg id=423>I'm carrying this inside the airplane.</seg>
<seg id=424>I'm hungry.</seg>
<seg id=425>This is a really delicious meal.</seg>
<seg id=426>There's a throbbing in my chest.</seg>
<seg id=427>Who's the writer of the script?</seg>
<seg id=428>A small-size car, please.</seg>

<seg id=70>Get me soup to start with.</seg>
<seg id=71>Yes. If I must say so, an eight hundred dollar cruise for a week isn't that luxurious. However, if a back cabin without a sea-view on a smaller boat is enough for you, we can offer you a few choices.</seg>
<seg id=72>It's located on the fourth floor.</seg>
<seg id=73>We can't manage to finish it. Can we take it home?</seg>
