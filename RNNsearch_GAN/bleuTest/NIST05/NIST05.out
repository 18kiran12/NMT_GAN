<EOS1> egypt 's spokesman for the middle east news agency quoted a high - ranking egyptian delegation to seek a consensus on a comprehensive settlement . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the middle east news agency said , " egypt , israel , palestine and important international groups , such as the united states and the european union , have reached an important understanding and agreed in principle to resolve the conflict between israel and palestine in principle . " 
<EOS1> since the death of UNK arafat last month , the international community has resumed the promotion of the middle east peace policy with a view to an early end to the bloody conflict between israelis and palestinians . <EOS2>

<EOS1> more than 1 billion children were devastated by war . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> according to the annual report issued today by the united nations children 's fund , the united nations children 's fund notes that more than half of the world 's half billion children are suffering from poverty , war and the UNK of aids . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the united nations children 's fund indicated that in 1989 children 's rights to the convention on the rights of the child had the right to a healthy and well - protected environment , often threatened by the failure of governments to implement human rights and economic reform . 
<EOS1> " when half of the world 's children are growing up in the cold and unhealthy environment , we have been unable to deliver on our commitments made to children , " the president of the united nations children 's fund said. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> " too many governments are making a deliberate decision to actually hurt children , " UNK said. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the united nations children 's fund , in collaboration with the london school of economics and the university of bristol , has compiled statistics on the horror of the dangers of children in most parts of the world . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the researchers found that around 60 million children in the world lacked access to safe drinking water and 400 million children could not have access to health - care services . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the researchers noted that , more severely , at least 700 million children suffer from various forms of " serious exploitation " , including lack of access to information and access to public health facilities . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the tenth annual report of the united nations children 's fund today states that war and aids have destroyed the various networks that can protect children , and that children become victims of war and aids from time to time . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> china to put pressure on the lifting of the arms embargo . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the european union has rejected china 's premier wen jiabao today and hopes to end the pressure on china 's arms embargo as soon as possible , but says it is committed to lifting the 15 - year embargo . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the president of the european union made the following statement following the summit meeting of the european union in UNK , china . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the netherlands says the eu does nothing to UNK the embargo and not to speculate . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the european union was imposed on the arms embargo imposed on beijing after the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> although the issue of the arms embargo was overshadowed by the summit of the eu summit in china , the two sides signed a number of trade and other agreements . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> both china and the european union claim that these agreements strengthened the " strategic partnership " between them . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the eu confirms its continued commitment to the lifting of the embargo , the european union said in a joint statement issued following a summit with chinese premier wen jiabao . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the statement noted that the chinese delegation " welcomes this positive message and believes that this message is conducive to the sound development of a broad strategic partnership between china and the european union " . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> mr wen did not hide his displeasure at the summit , saying the embargo " failed to reflect the partnership between china and the european union " . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> " the embargo is the result of the cold war , not a reflection of the current situation , but reflects the partnership between china and the european union , " wen said. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> some european union countries , led by france , pushed the lifting of the arms embargo , saying the ban was out of date . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the absence of an increase in the law of the european union , the european insight fears that the lifting of the embargo could open up the UNK of the UNK , which has fuelled chinese forces . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> " i explained the willingness of the european union to lift the embargo , but i also point out that the lifting of the ban is inextricably linked to the rules governing the export of arms , " said dutch prime minister UNK UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> preliminary study findings suggest that folic acid may lead to breast cancer , but it is not conclusive . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> an up - to - date health report noted that pregnant women had a high intake of vitamin b , a vitamin b , which was widely used by the fetus . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the researchers say , however , that their findings may only fall out of chance , because other studies suggest that folic acid actually reduces the probability of breast cancer and therefore calls pregnant women to continue taking the UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> folic acid naturally exists in the dark leafy vegetables , known to the medical community , which is an important aid to embryo development . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> researchers at the university of UNK and UNK in the uk conducted a follow - up of three thousand women who had been used in the second phase of their pregnancy and the third phase in their pregnancy . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the report , published in the british journal of medicine , noted that the percentage of women with breast cancer was twice as successful as placebo in september 2002 . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK , one of the researchers , stressed that the result is only " a way to point out further research . " <EOS2> 
<EOS1> " this may be an accidental result , " he said , noting that further scientific research must be done before any conclusions can be reached , and if the relationship exists . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> according to UNK , the number of pregnant women in pregnancy should still be UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> he said that the current dose and the experimental dose there would be a significant difference . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> according to the uk health guidelines , pregnant and female - born women during the first part of pregnancy should be given a daily allowance of four UNK of folic acid , a dose of 10 times more than those used by women in the study . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> ukraine 's presidential re - election of two candidates are very different . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the two rivals that will meet again in the presidential re - election of the president of ukraine on the 26 th of this month , have been prepared to do so . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the leader of the pro - western opposition , UNK UNK , is confident that the current prime minister in moscow will no longer represent " shameful " ruling party . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the same time , russia 's president , UNK UNK , has changed the eu approach to ukraine , saying he is happy with his country 's presence in the eu . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> he looked forward to hearing from reporters at the press conference venue that " in the conservative sense , i should have received about 60 % of the vote . " <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on the other hand , from the outward appearance of his anxious UNK several times a few flash dodge direct answer reporter 's question , only finally said a : " on the UNK , we will win . " <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK , who was formerly an heir to the current presidential gallery , has UNK himself with the opposition and opposition parties . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> he said in an almost immediate way , he said , " i have been disappointed in believing that now i trust those cowards and traitors that work under the government . this government is a shame . " <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the UNK and opposition parties exchange rules to transfer part of presidential powers to congress to end the opposition and political chaos that lasted two weeks since the presidential election of 21 november . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK UNK , who had won the original victory , was declared invalid on the ground that the supreme court had been campaigning for irregularities in the election process and must be re - elected. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> bauer is going to visit the hague for the last time in the presidency of europe and america . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> u . s . secretary of state powell met with senior european union leaders at the top of the european union for the last time in his tenure as the united states and europe . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the purpose of the european tour was to repair diplomatic injuries caused by the war in iraq , which was the last of its kind . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK could be his last official overseas visit and the european union promised him that the eu would stride forward to resolve tensions ahead of us president bush 's visit in february next year . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , the UNK on both sides still exist . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> " we must strengthen our bilateral dialogue and resume our common position in the second term , " said president UNK UNK of the european union . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the european commissioner for foreign affairs , ms . UNK UNK , said she believed that europe and the united states had made progress in throwing iraq into the " difficult moments of the crisis in iraq " , but she acknowledged the current " crucial moment " of 
<EOS1> bush will fly to brussels and nato leaders next year . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> bauer said UNK was committed to repair the rift caused by iraq . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK has visited UNK and brussels , but progress in improving relations is limited. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in brussels , particularly in brussels , mr bauer has said that the six nato countries opposed to the war refused to take part in the iraqi training mandate that has damaged the " credibility and solidarity " of UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but bauer insists his meeting has demonstrated the commitment of the united states to fully resume diplomatic relations . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK , the romanian president , was challenged by the government of romania . <EOS2>

<EOS1> UNK said his social democrats would help UNK UNK to join the european union . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the social democrats won the elections held on august 28 th . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK UNK said in a press conference today , " today my top priority is to be able to play as fast as the government is able to continue the eu talks . romania must strive to meet the demands of the eu . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> he stressed that the romanian people should know what price the integration would be , and that the country should be united in order to ensure that romania did not question the UNK of that integration . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> romania has completed the eu accession negotiations and is scheduled to join the eu in 2007 . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK will also fight poverty , UNK and ensuring the independence of the judiciary . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK UNK UNK buddha UNK and turkey UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the film director , UNK UNK , is taking advantage of the opportunity to announce the new " alexander in alexandria " in UNK , turkey . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> he wrote the classic " midnight express " script for the destruction of turkey . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> " i never thought the play would be hostile to turkey , " he told afp , in an interview with turkey . " this is a fight against injustice . " <EOS2> 
<EOS1> turkey has condemned the history of the history of the east since its premiere in 1978 . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> an adaptation of UNK 's memoirs . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the u . s . youth UNK was arrested at fort UNK airport after an attempt to smuggle drugs from turkey and was sentenced to 30 years in turkey after lengthy legal proceedings . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> turkey 's critics accuse the UNK of any UNK script with racial discrimination , and everyone in turkey is portrayed as a villain . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the film is full of appalling prison scenes and abuse . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK admitted : " perhaps because he was young , because he was too eager to express his views , he was too strong , and he was feverish and angry . " <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but he added , " UNK was sentenced to death in the turkish prison where he was sentenced to 30 years in prison for his petty crimes , and he was treated cruelly in prison , so everything was based on facts . " <EOS2> 
<EOS1> " in the big way , turkey is not the only country in which a prison system works , " said UNK . " the united states has similar problems . " <EOS2> 
<EOS1> next year , japan 's economic growth rate could slow . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> as the yen UNK and the widening gap between the rich and the poor could undermine the climate of harmony enjoyed in the first half of the year , the japanese economy could slow down further into 2005 . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> after ten years of stagnation , the firm 's gains in profits and consumer spending were strong , helping to restore confidence this year , but analysts expect growth from japan and china . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> evidence has emerged that the japanese economy is likely to slump briefly in early 2005 , especially if the industry continues to decline , while manufacturers adjust stocks to avoid a backlog of excess stocks . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> according to the recently adopted new methods of statistics , the economy of japan has contracted slightly in the first quarter of june to a slight contraction of between 7 and 9 per cent in september . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at present , economists still disagree about the UNK of japan 's economy . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK bank researchers estimate that the fiscal year ending until march next year , the real growth rate of the japanese economy can be UNK % . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> they say the " year of recovery " in 2005 was justified on the basis of a sound return to recovery in the us economy , as well as japanese consumer spending to offset the slowdown in export . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the other pessimistic view is that the growth rate of economists at the UNK institute for the fiscal year is only 8 % , lower growth rates from the next fiscal year to 6 % . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> they cited the potential risk , meaning that the profits of a firm did not lead to personal gains . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> law UNK the middle east peace progress will test the law and the united states <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the french foreign minister , UNK UNK , met with u . s . secretary of state jan UNK today to restore the peace talks in the middle east that will test their transatlantic relations . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> after the death of palestinian leader UNK UNK , france has appealed for a swift international seminar that could not lead to an agreement on the end of the israeli - palestinian peace process . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> from paris to washington , d . c . , he turned to brussels to attend a european union summit after lightning talks with his country 's security adviser , UNK and its UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> paris and washington agreed to repair the strained relations between iraq and iraq last year , but the two countries remained clear about the middle east deadlock . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> " we want the improvement of the law of america , the future of europe and america , and the future of europe and america , " mr UNK said after a brief talk at the u . s . department of state . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> " i think the test of the core of the relationship lies in our ability to promote the peace process between palestine and israel , " he said. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> mr UNK called earlier this week to call for an early international seminar on the middle east to use the " window of opportunity " he calls his death last month . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but bauer is still unwilling to commit . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> he said that the british plan to hold a meeting attended by palestinians did not make any reference to the broader international conference . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> officials in the united states have shown that their first task is to promote local peace on the ground , to ensure the smooth conduct of the palestinian elections next month . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the elections will lead to a leader who can control militant islamic militants and restore peace talks . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK UNK proposed japan and south korea to negotiate in january next year . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK UNK , japan 's UNK UNK , today proposed that japan and south korea and south korea begin talks on the issue of the signing of the free trade treaty of UNK early next year . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> according to the current newsletter , the UNK and the south korean ministers of commerce and commerce , UNK UNK , said they were expected to resume negotiations before the end of 2005 . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> japanese prime minister UNK koizumi and south korean president roh UNK - UNK met with ban ki - moon in talks with ban ki - moon in talks to urge the tokyo authorities to be cautious about imposing economic sanctions on north korea . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> north korea kidnapped japanese nationals during the cold war , and prime minister UNK koizumi is under pressure to punish north korea for its huge pressure . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> following japan 's study last week , the japanese authorities decided that the remains of pyongyang 's authorities to prove that the remains of the two hostages were not the remains of the remains of the parties was UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> aside from the abductions , mr koizumi and mr UNK agreed that the six - party talks aimed at curbing north korea 's nuclear weapons should resume as soon as possible . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the first three rounds of six rounds of sixparty talks have not yielded concrete results since the start of the north korea nuclear program for the development of nuclear weapons . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the UNK cup was originally scheduled for the fourth round of sixparty talks in september this year . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> six of the sixparty talks are south korea , north korea , america , china , japan and russia . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> thailand 's prime minister , UNK UNK , is still bullish on the january election next year . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> thai prime minister UNK UNK , the prime minister of thailand , entered the second half of the year , with confidence that he could win the second four - year tenure , but he has been damaged by the failure to quell the separatist insurgency . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> thailand 's national election is scheduled to take place on february 6 th next year , with mr UNK and his political rivals preparing for most analysts believe he will win despite violent clashes and bird flu outbreaks in the south . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> thailand has seen a total of 12 bird flu outbreaks in most of asia this year , especially in thailand , where the thai government has acknowledged its handling of the epidemic . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , the health problem is unlikely to prevent mr UNK from being re - elected on the contrary , and that many people are asking what he is going to do about his victory in the southern province . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK UNK , chairman of the foreign affairs committee of the congress , told afp : " the phenomenon here is that whatever you think of him , he is now enjoying broad support . " <EOS2> 
<EOS1> " but next year , however , the situation will begin , if you look at the accumulated wealth of his family and those around him , as well as social injustice and violence , " he said. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it is precisely because of social injustice and violence that most of thailand 's southern muslim majority of the population of the region will erupt , the sporadic insurgency began to occur in the months beginning . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> since the start of the year , muslims have been targeted by islamic activists , government officials and security forces that have committed suicide attacks and UNK , killing more than UNK people and missing hundreds of others . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the secretary of the israeli cabinet pointed out that arafat had been UNK a year ago . <EOS2>

<EOS1> but the survivors faced new difficulties , such as the deep - seated bureaucracy of indonesia , which UNK relief supplies around the world . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> " we 've lost everything and we 've lost everything and we 've lost everything and we 've lost everything and we 're starving , " said UNK UNK , a small village in the capital of aceh , the capital of indonesia 's state capital. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> " we 've seen the food , clothes and other relief items that have come to the UNK on television , " he said. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> mr UNK , like thousands of other refugees , had lost his identity and other official documents because of the tsunami , which made him a nightmare . <EOS2>

<EOS1> taiwan also called on china to pursue its democratic and political reform after the death of UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the overseas chinese UNK UNK is one of the greatest UNK in china , sacrificing political life in opposition to the bloody repression of tiananmen square . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> " in the fifteen years he was under house arrest , he publicly advocated political reform and progress towards the rule of law and democracy , " said UNK UNK , the president of the new york free china movement . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK will be remembered as a true democrat and principled man . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK have asked the chinese government to hold public funerals for the public and to evaluate his achievements fairly . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but they admit , mr UNK is unlikely to get so welcome , because the chinese government is concerned that people under communist party rule will use the opportunity to create unrest . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the UNK in 1989 was triggered by the death of UNK UNK . <EOS2>
