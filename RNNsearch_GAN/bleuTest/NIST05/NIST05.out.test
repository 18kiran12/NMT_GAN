<seg id=1>china is fighting the export of the european union to the lifting of the arms embargo</seg>
<seg id=1>the european union today rejected the pressure from premier wen jiabao , who hopes to end the embargo on china 's arms embargo as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=1>the president of the european union ( eu ) , the european union , was speaking at the current summit of the european union .</seg>
<seg id=1>the netherlands said that the european union would not be required to speculate on it .</seg>
<seg id=1>the eu was imposing sanctions on beijing after the tiananmen massacre in 1989 .</seg>
<seg id=1>while the issue of the arms embargo was overshadowed by the UNK , the two sides continued to sign agreements on several trade and other areas .</seg>
<seg id=1>china and the eu claim that these agreements strengthen the ' UNK ' relationship of strategic partnership .</seg>
<seg id=1>eu side confirmed its political will to lift the embargo , ' the eu said in a joint statement released after chinese premier wen jiabao held talks .</seg>
<seg id=1>the statement pointed out that the chinese delegation welcomed the positive message and believed that it would be helpful to the sound development of china 's extensive strategic partnership .</seg>
<seg id=1>speaking at the press conference after the summit , mr. wen said the embargo is not to reflect the partnership between china and the eu .</seg>
<seg id=1>the embargo is the result of the cold war , and it is not to be reflected in the current situation , and it does not reflect the partnership between china and the eu , wen said .</seg>
<seg id=1>some eu countries , under the french nuclear umbrella , pushed the lifting of the arms embargo , saying it was obsolete .</seg>
<seg id=1>without further strengthening of eu 's relevant laws , the european council was worried that the lifting of the embargo would be opened up to the flood control UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>i explained that the european union was willing to disarm the embargo , but i also pointed out that lifting the ban on the code of conduct for the export of arms trade was related to each other .</seg>
<seg id=1>the preliminary study shows that folic acid may lead to the UNK of breast cancer .</seg>
<seg id=1>a new health study showed that a vitamin b UNK , a vitamin b UNK , would increase the risk of breast cancer .</seg>
<seg id=1>however , the researchers said their findings might be just as accidental , as other research shows that folic acid actually lowers the rate of breast cancer .</seg>
<seg id=1>folic acid naturally exists in the dark UNK vegetable , which is known to be the important support force of the embryonic development .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to the researchers at the university of UNK and UNK , women who were pregnant in the 1960s were UNK or UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to the report in the british medical journal , women who had been infected with breast cancer had twice as much as placebo .</seg>
<seg id=1>UNK , one of the researchers , emphasized that the end of the study was just preliminary ... the goal was to point out further research .</seg>
<seg id=1>this is probably an accidental result , so it is necessary to make further scientific research to review the relevance , if the relevance is , said UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to ms . UNK , women who are pregnant are still going to take folic acid pills .</seg>
<seg id=1>there was a considerable gap between the current dose and the experimental use , he said .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to the uk health guidelines , it is expected that the pregnant women should use four UNK of folic acid for the first time of pregnancy .</seg>
<seg id=1>the president of ukraine has UNK the two candidates in the pattern of the two candidates</seg>
<seg id=1>the two rival , who will be sworn in to the presidency of ukraine on 26 october , are now well prepared .</seg>
<seg id=1>UNK UNK , the opposition leader of the opposition , says he will no longer be represented by the ruling party in the UNK ruling party .</seg>
<seg id=1>at the same time , president russian president vladimir putin expressed his views on ukraine 's entry to the eu .</seg>
<seg id=1>i 'm going to be able to get six to six of the votes , ' he told reporters , when he looked forward to the UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>on the other hand , UNK , from the visible aspect of the guise , UNK immediate answers to the questions .</seg>
<seg id=1>the UNK UNK , formerly incumbent president of UNK , now UNK himself to the opposition and the ruling communist party .</seg>
<seg id=1>i was disappointed that i was UNK and UNK , and now i was disappointed that the government was UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>UNK and the opposition exchange terms , through the modification of the law to congress , will end the opposition and political turmoil over the two weeks since the president elected by the president on 21 november .</seg>
<seg id=1>the UNK UNK , who had won the election by the supreme court , was declared elected and must be reelected .</seg>
<seg id=1>the last time the UNK visit to the hague on the one hand , and the european union</seg>
<seg id=1>u.s. secretary of state powell held talks with the european union today for the last time in his tenure to UNK his heart .</seg>
<seg id=1>the aim of UNK was to repair diplomatic injury to the two sides , the last stop in the hague .</seg>
<seg id=1>the UNK may be his last official visit abroad , while the european union vowed to settle down tensions between the two countries until february .</seg>
<seg id=1>but there is still a gap between the two sides on either side of the table .</seg>
<seg id=1>we have to strengthen our bilateral dialogue in the second term of president bush , and to UNK our common ground .</seg>
<seg id=1>ms . UNK , the european union 's foreign minister , says she believes that europe and the united states have made progress in the UNK of the UNK crisis , but she also realizes that it is the key moment of the UNK relationship .</seg>
<seg id=1>the bush administration will fly to brussels on 22 february next year to meet the european union and the north atlantic treaty organization .</seg>
<seg id=1>mr. UNK said the visit was intended to repair the relations that led to the iraqi factor .</seg>
<seg id=1>UNK has visited UNK and brussels , but the improvement is limited .</seg>
<seg id=1>in brussels , especially in brussels , the number of nato countries that criticized six opposing wars had been damaged to the UNK and solidarity of the iraqi training mission .</seg>
<seg id=1>but mr. UNK insists that his meetings have seen the united states ' commitment to the full recovery of diplomatic diplomacy .</seg>
<seg id=1>the former president of the republic of romania was facing the challenge</seg>
<seg id=1>the UNK opposition candidate UNK UNK , who heads the ruling party , will face enormous challenges as a result of the formation of the new government .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to the final and final results released by the central electoral commission of the romanian central elections , the UNK UNK , the candidate for the UNK , won the votes of UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>mr UNK admitted that he failed to be elected to the UNK and to the UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>UNK president UNK UNK , who is leaving the country , has also UNK UNK to the UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>mr. UNK says his social democrats will assist UNK to let romania join the european union .</seg>
<seg id=1>the democratic party won victory in the congressional elections held on 28 march .</seg>
<seg id=1>mr. UNK said in the press conference today , i have the most pressing task to continue to implement the government which has the capacity to continue to implement romania 's accession to the eu .</seg>
<seg id=1>he emphasized that the people of romania should be aware of the cost to which the consolidation would be , and that the country should be united to ensure that romania would not have questioned the UNK of the consolidation .</seg>
<seg id=1>romania has completed the european union 's accession negotiations and is expected to join the eu in 2007 .</seg>
<seg id=1>UNK , too , will struggle against poverty , corruption , and judicial independence as his policy agenda .</seg>
<seg id=1>UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK UNK and turkey UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>film director UNK UNK today offered the opportunity to extend the UNK , the UNK , to UNK , turkey .</seg>
<seg id=1>the classic he wrote , the UNK express , was taken to break the turkish image .</seg>
<seg id=1>i 've never thought that the play would be hostile to turkey , ' he told afp .</seg>
<seg id=1>the turkey public opinion has been condemning the east since the beginning of the UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>the book is based on the memoirs of UNK , which is based on the memoirs of the UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>the american youth UNK was sentenced to 30 years after the arrest of the UNK indian UNK , arrested after a long legal proceeding .</seg>
<seg id=1>the thrust of the turkey , which is described as the UNK , was described by the UNK as a UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>the film is also full of UNK prison riots and UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>UNK admitted that because of the young , too , it was too powerful to express too much enthusiasm and a little rage .</seg>
<seg id=1>but he added , UNK had been UNK in the turkish prison , for thirty years ' imprisonment in prison , and it was based on facts .</seg>
<seg id=1>at the level of the greater point , turkey is not the only country where the system of the prison system is not complete , said mr. UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>the pace of economic growth in the japanese economy may be slowed down next year</seg>
<seg id=1>with the deepening of the yen and the widening of the gap between the rich and the poor , the mood of the atmosphere that threatens to disrupt the economies of the first half of the year could be UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>after decades of stagnation , the company revived confidence this year , but analysts were hoping to point to china this year .</seg>
<seg id=1>the evidence has emerged that the japanese economy may be in short decline early in 2005 , especially if the manufacturing sector continued to decline , while manufacturers adjusted inventories to avoid UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to the newly adopted new statistical methods , the japanese economy had slightly shrunk in the last quarter of june and only one per cent increase of seven to september .</seg>
<seg id=1>at present , economists are still UNK about the UNK of the japanese economy .</seg>
<seg id=1>the UNK researchers estimate that the real growth rate of the japanese economy can be up to UNK by march .</seg>
<seg id=1>they said , in 2005 , the recovery year was based on the us economy 's UNK return to recovery tracks and the pace of export slowing .</seg>
<seg id=1>a more pessimistic view was that the economists at the institute of UNK estimated that the growth rate of the financial year was only 8 per cent .</seg>
<seg id=1>they have raised the potential risk that the profits of the manufacturer do not have the personal gains .</seg>
<seg id=1>UNK : the progress of peace in the middle east will test the relations of the united states</seg>
<seg id=1>french minister UNK UNK said today ( friday ) that the resumption of the middle east peace talks will be the test .</seg>
<seg id=1>the palestinian leader died after the death of france , calling for an international seminar to promote the peace process ; however , there was no sign of agreement .</seg>
<seg id=1>UNK was sent to washington from paris to attend a summit of the european union after the UNK talks with UNK and their UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>paris and washington agreed to repair the UNK ties of the united states in the united states last year , but it was still clear in the middle of the middle east .</seg>
<seg id=1>we want improvement of the future relations of the united states , europe and america , UNK said after a brief session of the state council .</seg>
<seg id=1>i think the test of the core is that we drive the palestinian and israeli peace process , he said .</seg>
<seg id=1>mr UNK earlier this week called for an early convening of an international conference on the opening of the opportunity to use his alleged UNK in the wake of the death last month .</seg>
<seg id=1>but mr. UNK is reluctant to come up with a promise to do so .</seg>
<seg id=1>he said that the two men spoke about the plans to be taken by the palestinians but did not mention whether to convene a broader international conference .</seg>
<seg id=1>u.s. officials have shown that their primary task is to promote peace in UNK and to ensure the palestinian elections in next month are proceeding smoothly .</seg>
<seg id=1>the election would lead to a leader who could control islamic militants and return to UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>the foreign minister of the kingdom of saudi arabia proposed that the talks will begin in january next year</seg>
<seg id=1>japanese foreign minister UNK UNK today proposed the talks between the two countries and south korea , and early next year on the signing of the freetrade agreement .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to the current bureau of communications and communications , mr. UNK said the two sides should resume negotiations as early as the end of 2005 .</seg>
<seg id=1>prior to the talks with mr ban , japanese prime minister junichiro koizumi and south korea 's president roh moohyun urged the tokyo authorities to take careful assessment of the dprk 's economic sanctions .</seg>
<seg id=1>north korea , which had kidnapped japanese nationals during the cold war , was facing demands for punishment of the enormous pressure from north korea .</seg>
<seg id=1>japanese researchers confirmed last week that pyongyang was angry that the country had been killed following the disappearance of the remains of the two hostages .</seg>
<seg id=1>in addition to the issue of kidnapping , koizumi and roh agreed to agree to stop the sixparty talks on north korea 's development .</seg>
<seg id=1>since the standoff broke out in october 2002 , the three UNK talks have not been met .</seg>
<seg id=1>the UNK talks are scheduled to be held in the fourth round of sixparty talks in october .</seg>
<seg id=1>six of the sixparty talks are south korea , north korea , the united states , china , japan and russia .</seg>
<seg id=1>thailand 's prime minister UNK UNK is still to be seen to be UNK to win in february .</seg>
<seg id=1>thailand 's prime minister UNK UNK , who was at the age of 2005 , was confident he could win the second four years , but his reputation was damaged because of his failure to quell the UNK insurgency .</seg>
<seg id=1>thailand 's national election was scheduled to be held on february 6 , next year , and most analysts believe that despite the violent conflict in the south and the outbreak of bird flu , UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>thailand has twelve people in asia because of bird flu . the bird flu epidemic has hit most parts of asia .</seg>
<seg id=1>however , the health problem is unlikely to allow mr. UNK to be able to be reelected ; on the contrary , many people simply ask him what degree he would like to win .</seg>
<seg id=1>the phenomenon is that no matter how you look at the UNK , he is now enjoying the support of the public .</seg>
<seg id=1>but next year , if you look at the accumulation of the wealth of his family and his neighbours , and social injustice and violence , he said .</seg>
<seg id=1>just because society is unfair and violent , south thailand 's southern muslim population is not going to burst out of the turmoil because of last week 's UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>since the beginning of this year , the islamic militant group has made UNK , government officials and security forces .</seg>
<seg id=1>mr. UNK 's secretary means that mr. UNK was appointed to be a year ago when she was elected .</seg>
<seg id=1>the secretary of the palestinian leader , UNK UNK , said that mr. UNK was UNK when a supporter of his delegation was welcomed by mr. UNK a year ago .</seg>
<seg id=1>about a year ago , mr. UNK said , the strange thing of UNK law was about 25 september 2003 .</seg>
<seg id=1>at that point , the president shook hands with his or her thirty , and the president appeared to have UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>since then , the health status of the president began to deteriorate .</seg>
<seg id=1>arafat was not aware of the disease and was in the french hospital on november 11 .</seg>
<seg id=1>the senior officials of the palestinian state have felt that UNK was UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>dr . france , however , said the charge was not based on the notion that it was not the case .</seg>
<seg id=1>the decision was made only two weeks before the office of the UNK delegation , the prime minister of israel , who decided to UNK the UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>israel , which threatened to support the wave of solidarity with the UNK , has been interviewed by supporters of UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>UNK recalled that arafat , who had come to shake hands with the people , was an inspiration to UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>on the evening of sept . 25 , arafat received two groups , one of which was from the world , the free UNK group , and the other to be political activists .</seg>
<seg id=1>mr. UNK said the last time of twelve october was the last sick , the same symptom was the vomiting , lack of appetite and all the symptoms similar to the flu .</seg>
<seg id=1>we have to admit that the training of the iraqi forces has to be strengthened .</seg>
<seg id=1>u.s. president bush today acknowledged that iraqi forces have yet to replace the united states , and warned that the general election to be held on 30 may .</seg>
<seg id=1>on a UNK press conference , bush also expressed his belief that the secretary general of the pentagon was expressing its support to the UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>in spite of times , he vowed to continue his cooperation with russian president UNK UNK , saying that it was just the time to move towards the end of the middle east conflict .</seg>
<seg id=1>he also felt that the best way to deal with the survival of the UNK members of iraq was to deal with the problems in iraq and north korea .</seg>
<seg id=1>the death toll on iraqi UNK yesterday killed six people and killed more than 200 people .</seg>
<seg id=1>bush told the american people that the elections were the beginning of the political process and warned that i certainly would not expect the process to be smooth .</seg>
<seg id=1>the bush administration also recognized that the training results of the iranian security forces had a good margin .</seg>
<seg id=1>he said , when we fought battles in some cases , they were going to escaped from the war .</seg>
<seg id=1>the iraqi forces will never be able to protect national security , ' he said .</seg>
