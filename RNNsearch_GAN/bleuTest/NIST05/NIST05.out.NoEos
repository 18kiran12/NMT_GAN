china to put pressure on the lifting of the arms embargo .
the european union has rejected china 's premier wen jiabao today and hopes to end the pressure on china 's arms embargo as soon as possible , but says it is committed to lifting the 15 - year embargo .
the president of the european union made the following statement following the summit meeting of the european union in UNK , china .
the netherlands says the eu does nothing to UNK the embargo and not to speculate .
the european union was imposed on the arms embargo imposed on beijing after the tiananmen square massacre in 1989 .
although the issue of the arms embargo was overshadowed by the summit of the eu summit in china , the two sides signed a number of trade and other agreements .
both china and the european union claim that these agreements strengthened the " strategic partnership " between them .
the eu confirms its continued commitment to the lifting of the embargo , the european union said in a joint statement issued following a summit with chinese premier wen jiabao .
the statement noted that the chinese delegation " welcomes this positive message and believes that this message is conducive to the sound development of a broad strategic partnership between china and the european union " .
mr wen did not hide his displeasure at the summit , saying the embargo " failed to reflect the partnership between china and the european union " .
" the embargo is the result of the cold war , not a reflection of the current situation , but reflects the partnership between china and the european union , " wen said.
some european union countries , led by france , pushed the lifting of the arms embargo , saying the ban was out of date .
in the absence of an increase in the law of the european union , the european insight fears that the lifting of the embargo could open up the UNK of the UNK , which has fuelled chinese forces .
" i explained the willingness of the european union to lift the embargo , but i also point out that the lifting of the ban is inextricably linked to the rules governing the export of arms , " said dutch prime minister UNK UNK .
preliminary study findings suggest that folic acid may lead to breast cancer , but it is not conclusive .
an up - to - date health report noted that pregnant women had a high intake of vitamin b , a vitamin b , which was widely used by the fetus .

UNK , one of the researchers , stressed that the result is only " a way to point out further research . "
" this may be an accidental result , " he said , noting that further scientific research must be done before any conclusions can be reached , and if the relationship exists .
according to UNK , the number of pregnant women in pregnancy should still be UNK
he said that the current dose and the experimental dose there would be a significant difference .
according to the uk health guidelines , pregnant and female - born women during the first part of pregnancy should be given a daily allowance of four UNK of folic acid , a dose of 10 times more than those used by women in the study .

next year , japan 's economic growth rate could slow .
as the yen UNK and the widening gap between the rich and the poor could undermine the climate of harmony enjoyed in the first half of the year , the japanese economy could slow down further into 2005 .
after ten years of stagnation , the firm 's gains in profits and consumer spending were strong , helping to restore confidence this year , but analysts expect growth from japan and china .

at present , economists still disagree about the UNK of japan 's economy .
UNK bank researchers estimate that the fiscal year ending until march next year , the real growth rate of the japanese economy can be UNK % .
they say the " year of recovery " in 2005 was justified on the basis of a sound return to recovery in the us economy , as well as japanese consumer spending to offset the slowdown in export .
the other pessimistic view is that the growth rate of economists at the UNK institute for the fiscal year is only 8 % , lower growth rates from the next fiscal year to 6 % .
they cited the potential risk , meaning that the profits of a firm did not lead to personal gains .
