<seg id=1>today , however , the experts view it as a more serious problem that leads to the interruption of contacts .</seg>
<seg id=1>the UNK started to mars on wednesday , and began to search the red planet last week for signs of life .</seg>
<seg id=1>the ' UNK ' opportunity no ' opportunity ' opportunity is scheduled to fall overnight from january 24 to 25 .</seg>

<seg id=1>after consultation with japan , the united states and japan are very optimistic about the talks with mr. UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>( afp , washington , d . 22 ) the u.s. said today that it is optimistic that the resumption of talks should be terminated as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=1>we believe that the hope of the resumption talks will be very large , but there is still no clear date at present .</seg>
<seg id=1>in talks with japan and south korea , mr. kelly said that the possibility of the second round of talks remains high and it would be possible to encourage north korea to agree to the UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>we believe that the possibility of holding the sixparty talks is very significant .</seg>
<seg id=1>however , he said that the agreement was to be widespread and including pyongyang 's willingness to accept guarantees to end its uranium enrichment program , and to deal with the current UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>north korea , which had told us unofficial representatives to produce their UNK , rejected the idea that pyongyang was speaking of enriching uranium when it met the talks .</seg>
<seg id=1>who has confirmed that viet nam has been infected with the sixth virus in vietnam</seg>
<seg id=1>( ii ) the world health organization ( UNK ) today confirmed that the world health organization ( who ) today confirmed viet nam 's sixth anniversary .</seg>
<seg id=1>this is the first confirmed avian deaths in the south of vietnam .</seg>

<seg id=1>another vietnamese health official noted the 22 day of the UNK hospital was also a pair of UNK victims of severe respiratory diseases .</seg>
<seg id=1>the bird flu virus in indonesia is one of the few million chickens in the world .</seg>
<seg id=1>( afp , jakarta , 25 monday ) the ministry of agriculture announced today that the outbreak of bird flu had killed millions of chicken , but so far there were no cases of human infection .</seg>
<seg id=1>UNK UNK , director of the agriculture department of the ministry of agriculture , told the public not to panic , and so far the country has so far not infected the country .</seg>
<seg id=1>seven countries have been killed in seven countries in asia , where six people have been killed .</seg>
<seg id=1>indonesian officials first said that the bird flu outbreak of poultry in java and UNK was UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>secretary general UNK UNK said in the morning that there is no evidence of the outbreak of bird flu in indonesia .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the evening , he told afp that the outbreak was not enough .</seg>
<seg id=1>most of the cases of bird flu in vietnam are infected by h5n1 virus .</seg>
<seg id=1>the spokesman said that the disease was associated with a type of UNK , which had killed more than UNK birds since last november .</seg>
<seg id=1>about 60 per cent of them are newly infected with the disease , and about 60 per cent of them die .</seg>
<seg id=1>he said that there was no order of an immediate and imminent killing .</seg>
<seg id=1>the state news agency quotes UNK 's remarks ; the authorities have been using the british and australian sera to test the virus .</seg>
<seg id=1>the snow cover the northwest europe for traffic and transport .</seg>
<seg id=1>( l . UNK , 29 , 29 , UNK ) over half of the area of western europe and northern europe , the greater part of the traffic and the railways , forcing the british , germany and denmark to cancel their elections .</seg>
<seg id=1>in london , a spokesman for the UNK airport said last night that the UNK caused more than 200 flights to be lifted last night .</seg>
<seg id=1>close to the other two airports in london , UNK and UNK were also covered by snow and 18 UNK were cancelled due to the weather .</seg>
<seg id=1>in germany , the winter weather causes at least 60 000 to fly to frankfurt international airport , and frankfurt is the largest airport in germany .</seg>
<seg id=1>the transport authorities say the UNK , which flies to frankfurt , may be affected by the UNK factors today .</seg>
<seg id=1>france , after the UNK of snow last monday , the similar measures taken by the rest of france have been lifted this morning .</seg>
<seg id=1>paris 's main airport services are back to normal , because of the delays in the UNK airport because of snow and mist .</seg>
<seg id=1>however , the airport authorities in paris suggested that travellers in the air are advised to identify whether their flights were on time .</seg>
<seg id=1>besides the mediterranean shore , parts of france have already been covered in the snow .</seg>
<seg id=1>taiwan and japan are dutybound and more responsible for the consolidation of democracy in asia .</seg>
<seg id=1>to promote democratic values , the chinese government has recently established the taiwan democratic foundation .</seg>
<seg id=1>the democratic republic of china hopes that , in this connection , the experience of democracy and the sharing of other countries will contribute to the peaceful , stable and prosperous asia .</seg>
<seg id=1>as the international situation evolves and changes in the international situation , the momentum of the momentum of the regional forces and the rise of the forces has been tested .</seg>
<seg id=1>for the asiapacific region , since the united states launched the war on iraq last month , the nuclear missiles have passed many UNK missiles and flew over japan .</seg>
<seg id=1>all this has posed serious threats to the security of the two sides in the asiapacific region .</seg>
<seg id=1>these UNK issues require formal security mechanisms to get discussion and resolution .</seg>
<seg id=1>today 's meeting is the formal dialogue between the ruling communist party of china and the democratic party of the communist party of china .</seg>
<seg id=1>i also wish to extend the dialogue between the two sides of the strait , the japanese side , the united states and other asian countries .</seg>
<seg id=1>today is an important occasion for us to push forward our path to reform , and to make sure that all party comrades can reflect the will of the party and work together to achieve the reform goals .</seg>
<seg id=1>the withdrawal from the medium and the media media is the most fundamental requirement for the implementation of the media reform as well as the sustained step by the ruling .</seg>
<seg id=1>we also know that in order to promote the goal , party members of the party 's public service party , as well as the UNK of the media , will be a small step forward .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the era of the media monopoly in the period of the last period of the period of the martial law , many party comrades invested in the space of the open and fourth , local radio and other mass media .</seg>
<seg id=1>for instance , the UNK was born to the fourth wireless television station , to put money into it .</seg>
<seg id=1>this would have significant influence on the whole of the media , especially in the process of three long periods of monopoly .</seg>
<seg id=1>however , we must understand that because of the limitation of the historical circumstances , there are many UNK in the process of promoting reform .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to the statement , all party members of the public office of the central committee of the communist party of china , the general office of the state council , were elected by the courts under the courts of the state council .</seg>
<seg id=1>we are heartened by the ideals and goals of the communist party , which include the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK , the UNK and the UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>the ruling is not the right to the power but the aggravation of the responsibility .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the process of governance , democracy has always been able to challenge us to the stability of the united states .</seg>
<seg id=1>as we all always believed , the people were the masters of the country , the spirit of democratic progressive party , and the light vision of reform , progress and life .</seg>
<seg id=1>for the long time , democratic UNK has played a role in the development of the taiwan diplomacy and created the splendid results .</seg>
<seg id=1>in spite of the continuous failure of the communist party , we never retreat because the destiny is still in the hands of our own hands .</seg>
<seg id=1>over the past year , we have been able to share exchanges and political exchanges with the countries in the region on the basis of the asian free association .</seg>
<seg id=1>by the end of next march , i will also take over as chairman of the asian free alliance ( UNK ) , hoping to take the opportunity of the leader of the international organization as the leader of the international community .</seg>
<seg id=1>in addition , the democratic party has taken an active part in relevant relevant meetings last year .</seg>
<seg id=1>in addition to the high commissioner for human rights at the headquarters of london secretariat , it will also engage in political reforms in central south america and europe .</seg>
<seg id=1>the party has been celebrating the 21st anniversary of the communist party of china .</seg>
<seg id=1>the democratic party of seventeen years , however , always persists in the ideals of democracy and the strength of reform and progress .</seg>
<seg id=1>because we have been on the side of the democratic reform , we have been able to win the trust of the people of taiwan , and for this reason , our responsibility and our mission is essential .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the last three years , the ruling party has been in the process of making the following three stages .</seg>
<seg id=1>from 1991 to the end of the year 2000 , the general assembly of the people 's republic of china , the government of the people 's republic of china , and the ministry of the people 's republic of china , and the ministry of the people</seg>
<seg id=1>if we were elected to taiwan in 1996 , it was the most important symbol of the sovereign right to become the sovereign right .</seg>
<seg id=1>after more than ten years of practice , we need to think that as a sovereign state with independent sovereignty , what should be pursued</seg>
<seg id=1>i must say that the next stage we should expand our quest for democracy and more efficient constitutional institutions to steer the taiwan people to accept the severe challenge of the new century .</seg>
<seg id=1>asia is the biggest continent in the world , which accounts for nearly 60% of the world 's population , accounting for 60 percent of the world 's total population .</seg>
<seg id=1>asia has a long and splendid culture , the yellow river and the yangtze river , the UNK and the UNK valley , the young UNK river and the euphrates river .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the long history , the people of asia have written a glorious chapter in the development of human civilization .</seg>
<seg id=1>the people of all countries have made tremendous achievements in the struggle for liberation , development and development .</seg>
<seg id=1>but it is still a long way to go to realize the rise and rejuvenation of asia .</seg>
<seg id=1>to strengthen cooperation , promote development and achieve winwin results is the only way asian emergence and rejuvenation are the fundamental interests of the asian people .</seg>
<seg id=1>under the new situation of the new century , asia 's development faces new opportunities .</seg>
<seg id=1>peace and development remain the theme of the present era , and the international environment for the general peace provides an enabling external condition for asian development .</seg>
<seg id=1>the rapid development of the global economy , the revolution of world science and technology , the optimization of the global scientific and technological revolution and the acceleration of the industrial transfer by the international market</seg>
<seg id=1>the rich resources of asia are the most vibrant regions in the world today .</seg>
<seg id=1>the number of people who are more and less developed is the national conditions of china .</seg>
<seg id=1>china has 1.3 billion people , regardless of whether it is 1.3 billion , is a big problem .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is the chinese leader that must be kept in mind at any time .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is impossible to solve the problems of 1.3 billion people , but they cannot depend on themselves .</seg>
<seg id=1>since the founding of the people 's republic , china has made great achievements in its construction .</seg>
<seg id=1>since the beginning of reform and openingup in 1978 , we finally found a way to develop ourselves .</seg>
<seg id=1>this is the case of the chinese people to independently build socialism with chinese characteristics .</seg>
<seg id=1>the spirit of the road is to mobilize all positive factors , to liberate and develop the productive forces , to respect and protect the freedom of the chinese people .</seg>
<seg id=1>china 's reform and opening up , from the countryside to the city , to the political , cultural and social spheres .</seg>
<seg id=1>every step further , in the final analysis , is to UNK all labor , knowledge , technology , management and capital , so as to give full flow of all social wealth .</seg>
<seg id=1>in recent years , the world is undergoing profound changes , and the world is constantly improving and closer to the world .</seg>
<seg id=1>however , it is worth noting that stability and development are still being threatened in the world .</seg>
<seg id=1>the negative impact of the economic globalization increases the risks and costs of developing countries ' economic and social development , and some developing countries have even faced marginalization .</seg>
<seg id=1>at present , although the world economy is recovering , many uncertainties remain .</seg>
<seg id=1>the doha round of multilateral trade negotiations was frustrated and the complex factors such as trade protectionism had increased the difficulties of developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is gratifying to note that the great number of developing countries has made remarkable achievements and achieved remarkable achievements .</seg>
<seg id=1>on the international stage , the developing countries , relying on the nonaligned movement and the group of 77 groups , have made important contributions to the efforts to safeguard their legitimate rights and UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>at the same time , exchanges and cooperation between the developing countries have scored remarkable achievements and more frequent economic exchanges .</seg>
<seg id=1>from the andean range to the mekong river , the establishment of the maghreb union to the african union , from the elements to the form , has been enriched , refined and updated .</seg>
<seg id=1>the past year was also the year of allround development of the friendly relations and cooperation between china and canada .</seg>
<seg id=1>the two countries have maintained the momentum of growth of trade and the total value of trade is nearly $10 billion .</seg>
<seg id=1>more importantly , the leaders of the supreme court of the chinese court , ministers of foreign affairs , ministers of environment and ministers of the international cooperation have visited china .</seg>
<seg id=1>premier wen jiabao 's recent visit to canada has forged a UNK for the further development of bilateral friendly cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=1>the two countries will continue to strengthen cooperation in the fields of politics , economy , culture and science and technology .</seg>
<seg id=1>your friends , as well as you are , my friend , as well as my friends .</seg>
<seg id=1>as you are overseas , we have always been looking for the development of the motherland .</seg>
<seg id=1>last year , after the sars and floods in some parts of china , you also expressed deep solicitude and blessing to the people of the motherland .</seg>
<seg id=1>premier wen jiabao visited china during premier wen 's visit to the chinese premier , while hundreds of overseas students and students stayed against the cold .</seg>
<seg id=1>here , i would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to you and to believe that you will continue to contribute to the reunification of china in the new year .</seg>
<seg id=1>first , we will strengthen the political trust and deepen the strategic cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=1>the two countries , as the permanent members of the un security council , are countries which have an important impact on international affairs .</seg>
<seg id=1>we both advocate for the promotion of global multipolarization , safeguarding the authority of the united nations , and willing to contribute to the establishment of an international political and economic UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>we share broad consensus and common interests in addressing the challenges and the proper handling of major international issues .</seg>
<seg id=1>we are willing to strengthen dialogue and consultation with the united kingdom in combating terrorism , proliferation , combating transnational crime , promoting common development and strengthen the role of the united nations .</seg>
<seg id=1>second , we will strengthen the economic and trade cooperation and achieve mutual complementarity .</seg>
<seg id=1>china is the largest developing country in the world , and is now working on modernization and the broad market .</seg>
<seg id=1>france is the developed country , but the economic and technological level is in the forefront of the world .</seg>
<seg id=1>the two countries are complementary to each other , and the potentials of economic and trade cooperation are huge .</seg>
<seg id=1>since the founding of new china , the chinese government has always attached great importance to the development of bilateral ties and formulated a series of policy policy .</seg>
<seg id=1>we have always adhered to the five principles of peaceful coexistence , respect for the african countries to choose the political system and the road to development ; to provide assistance to african countries .</seg>
<seg id=1>the friendship between china and china is long and long and long .</seg>
<seg id=1>since the founding of new china , we have always stood firmly in support of the african national liberation and sincerely aid the african countries to develop the national economy .</seg>
<seg id=1>china experts , doctors , teachers , workers and workers who have been sent to africa are working together , UNK and UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>in international affairs , china and the african countries recognize and support each other and become partners of mutual trust .</seg>
<seg id=1>the chinese people never forget that , with the strong support of the sixteenth general assembly of the united nations , china has smoothly resumed the legitimate seat of the united nations .</seg>
<seg id=1>in recent years , the political trust between the two sides has been deepened and the bilateral economic and trade cooperation has developed .</seg>
<seg id=1>the two sides decided to establish a new partnership of longterm stability , equality and mutual benefit , and the friendly cooperation between the two countries has entered a new stage of comprehensive development .</seg>
<seg id=1>seven years after nixon 's visit to the chinese and us markets , the government accepted china 's position on the taiwan issue and achieved diplomatic relations .</seg>
<seg id=1>the incident and the successful visit to the united states opened up the new chapter of chinaus relations .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the early days of the reagan administration , the united states had an intense interest in the taiwan issue .</seg>
<seg id=1>after strenuous negotiations , the two governments issued the famous UNK communiqu in 1982 and reached agreement on a stepbystep solution to the issue of arms sales .</seg>
<seg id=1>the shanghai communiqu , the communiqu on the establishment of diplomatic relations and the UNK communiqu , jointly constitute the political cornerstone of chinaus relations .</seg>
<seg id=1>during the decade after the establishment of diplomatic ties , despite the struggles of the two countries on issues such as taiwan , the bilateral relationship was stable and exchanges and cooperation in various fields increased .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the 1980s and early 1990s , the collapse of eastern europe , the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war , the international situation took place since world war ii .</seg>
<seg id=1>the united states has led the united states to announce that the united states , the united nations , the united nations , the united nations , the united nations , the united nations , the united nations , the united nations , the united nations and the</seg>
<seg id=1>with the rapid development of the chinese economy , china has steadily improved its international position .</seg>
<seg id=1>more and more people in the united states recognize that the improvement and development of sinous relations serves the interests of the two countries .</seg>
<seg id=1>six months ago , we successfully launched the sixparty talks process and established the direction for the peaceful settlement of the nuclear issue .</seg>
<seg id=1>over the year , the parties have held silent dialogue and consultations , and made tremendous and thorough preparation for the holding of the new round of talks , and through this process , and enhancing understanding of each other .</seg>
<seg id=1>the parties look forward to the second round of talks to discuss the substantive issues and achieve tangible results .</seg>
<seg id=1>these are an important basis for our talks .</seg>
<seg id=1>the second round of talks is the beginning of discussions on the real problem , marking another new step forward in the peace process .</seg>
<seg id=1>this round of talks will focus on how to set the goal of solving the nuclear issue , and to probe into the formulation of the first phase of the nuclear issue .</seg>
<seg id=1>as the talks are going to be deeper , we will also be able to deal with more difficulties and meet more challenges , but it is exactly the responsibility of the international community and the international community .</seg>
<seg id=1>the six parties are here to represent the strong political aspiration of the governments and peoples of the six countries .</seg>
<seg id=1>our talks are to expand the agreement , not to highlight differences ; it is to address problems rather than intensifying contradiction .</seg>
<seg id=1>china believes that all sides are aware of the peaceful commitment of the peace and the spirit of cooperation and understanding , and in the spirit of mutual respect , demonstrating flexibility and narrowing the gap .</seg>
<seg id=1>after more than three days of negotiations , the second round of the sixparty talks has accomplished the agenda .</seg>
<seg id=1>i wish to express my appreciation to the governments of all countries and to your excellency and representatives and staff .</seg>
<seg id=1>if the first round of talks lays down the goal of the denuclearization of the peninsula , the significance of this round is the substantial dialogue and a new step towards achieving the big goals .</seg>
<seg id=1>during the talks , the parties conducted indepth and constructive discussions to explore ways and means to solve the problem with wisdom and reason .</seg>
<seg id=1>the talks won a series of useful results , especially if the agreement reached consensus on the next round of talks and the establishment of the working group .</seg>
<seg id=1>dear colleagues , peace and development are the themes of our great era .</seg>
<seg id=1>the peoples of the six countries represent the need for peace , for peace and peace , and people all over the world need peace , aspirations for peace , love and peace .</seg>
<seg id=1>on the third day , the international community watched beijing and gazed at the diaoyutai state .</seg>
<seg id=1>it may be said that the talks will not be enough , and the process is not fast enough .</seg>
<seg id=1>my view was that the talks were launched in the context of the lack of mutual trust , the gap between the two sides .</seg>
<seg id=1>the chinese government 's position on the taiwan issue is consistent , namely , the basic principle of peaceful reunification and one country , two systems .</seg>
<seg id=1>to this end , we have done everything possible to show the utmost sincerity and do many work .</seg>
<seg id=1>however , our efforts have been UNK by the taiwan authorities and the taiwan independence forces .</seg>
<seg id=1>we respect the democratic demands of the people of taiwan , but we oppose the taiwan independence secessionist activities , the name of taiwan independence and taiwan independence .</seg>
<seg id=1>our resolve and the will to safeguard our country 's reunification is to safeguard peace and stability in the taiwan straits .</seg>
<seg id=1>we have indicated that , as long as we are hopeful , we will try our utmost to achieve the reunification of the motherland .</seg>
<seg id=1>we appreciate the reaffirmation of president bush to reiterate the adherence to one china position and to give clear signals to the taiwan independence forces .</seg>
<seg id=1>the leader of the taiwan authorities claimed that , in order to prevent the infringement of china 's armed forces , the current situation of the two sides should be reversed .</seg>
<seg id=1>this is the UNK of the chinese mainland peace efforts and the provocation of crossstraits relations .</seg>
<seg id=1>at present , the real threat to the security of taiwan is not the mainland but the secessionist activities of the taiwan authorities .</seg>
<seg id=1>the taiwan independence secessionist force is not a direct source of the damage to the current state of crossstrait relations and the peace of the straits .</seg>
<seg id=1>the taiwan authorities have taken as a pretext for the suppression of the taiwan independence secessionist and the stability of the taiwan straits to the democracy and freedom of the taiwan .</seg>
<seg id=1>this is UNK and UNK , and it is the continuation of the UNK and support .</seg>
<seg id=1>the taiwanese authorities have claimed to be held socalled defense investment , peaceful referendum , but in all cases , such provocative acts only provoke confrontation and hatred between the two sides .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is the general objection to the taiwan 's democracy and the international community .</seg>
<seg id=1>throughout the history of the chinese nation , it is always the mainstream , and it is the general trend and the general trend .</seg>
<seg id=1>as the motherland grew more and more , the cooperation of the two sides was strengthened , and the international community was universally recognized that the situation of china was more consolidated and that any splitting attempt was doomed to failure .</seg>
<seg id=1>more than two weeks were the lunar new year , one of the traditional festivals for the chinese .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the midst of this exciting day , we are accustomed to meeting the UNK and the UNK , exchanging the present and exchanging the heart .</seg>
<seg id=1>in accordance with the spirit of the spirit and the business opportunities , hongkong post cooperated with the chinese post to carry out their thoughts and wishes to the relatives and customers of hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=1>hongkong post has been working with other postal agencies to provide international logistics service .</seg>
<seg id=1>early in december 2002 , the UNK and the australian postal services were introduced to provide quality service to the hong kong people .</seg>
<seg id=1>we will work closely with china to extend our bilateral ties to the mainland .</seg>
<seg id=1>the first batch consisted of UNK UNK , which included UNK , tea and UNK , and there were many choices .</seg>
<seg id=1>both the friends and the business partners of the mainland are all worthy of a decent gift .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the past 30 years , the council has made remarkable contributions to the protection of consumer interests .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is important to assess the effectiveness of the council 's work and the best way to see if the consumer 's rights are improved .</seg>
<seg id=1>i agree with the chairman that , after 30 years , the government and the people of society also attach great importance to the interests of consumers .</seg>
<seg id=1>the council is conducting regular surveys of the product and conducting market surveys and studies on different products and services , and through the introduction of fair and objective market information to the public .</seg>
<seg id=1>the selection , which is highly appreciated by the public , is now on the basis of the choice of the journal .</seg>
<seg id=1>the council has 11 district consumer advice centres and 16 telephone hotline to provide consumers with information on goods and services and to accept complaints of consumers .</seg>
<seg id=1>the council has since established to increase the number of enquiries received from the end of the 1970s .</seg>
<seg id=1>in addition , the council handled more than 20,000 complaints this year on the issue of the council .</seg>
<seg id=1>the council will also publish a number of UNK shops , not only to help consumers watch UNK , but also to the operators .</seg>
<seg id=1>when i told you i was very carefully watching the tv , i told you that i had a lot to think about .</seg>
<seg id=1>in this connection , both the government and i have worked in the past six and seven months to improve the understanding of the public .</seg>
<seg id=1>i am also clear of the democratic appeal of the society .</seg>
<seg id=1>but , UNK , i want to tell you that i 'm doing it right now . i 'm going to have to do it well .</seg>
<seg id=1>what is the basic problem is what to do with the basic question</seg>
<seg id=1>some are the questions of principle , and others are the problems of the law .</seg>
<seg id=1>we are doing our part of the work , and one of the three groups has begun to work in this area .</seg>
<seg id=1>it will be consulted by the central authorities and will be able to hear from hong kong , and i feel that it is a good step for us to take note of the views of the hong kong society .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the face of today 's fierce business environment , brand is the key to the success of the product .</seg>
<seg id=1>to make the brand name , not one night , we must have creative design , excellent quality , excellent packaging and continuous investment .</seg>
<seg id=1>we have the right to create brand names in hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=1>we have the knowledge , skills and experience ; from the design , manufacturing and marketing to the management , we have a broad market .</seg>
<seg id=1>the recent implementation of cepa will increase our strength , in addition to the high tariff preference for the mainland market , and to promote the proliferation of products by encouraging the UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>the chinese manufacturers will play an important role in the development of hong kong 's top ten famous brands .</seg>
<seg id=1>over the past five years , the election has led to the creation of more than 51 hong kong brand names .</seg>
<seg id=1>however , in the face of the vast market in the mainland , we need hundreds , thousands , and more of hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=1>hong kong has been actively participating in the subway projects in the mainland china for many years , taking them to the mainland market through the service form .</seg>
<seg id=1>i am very happy to invest in hong kong and to the quality of our professional and management services .</seg>
<seg id=1>the exchanges between hong kong and hong kong are not only supportive of the development of the motherland , but also more opportunities for the development of the economy .</seg>
<seg id=1>i am very grateful to the chinese government and the shenzhen special economic zone .</seg>
<seg id=1>the commencement of the mtr corporation ( UNK ) is the first time that the mtr corporation ( UNK ) enters hong kong to participate in the development of the domestic subway in an investment form .</seg>
<seg id=1>i would like to wish the municipal government to announce formally the central government 's official approval at an early date .</seg>
<seg id=1>at the beginning of the year , i am very happy to be invited to attend the opening ceremony of the gold and silver trade .</seg>
<seg id=1>i wish to congratulate you all on the first day , and i wish you all the spirit and the spirit of the dragon to come to and come to the sea .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the past year , the price of gold has soared , and the latest breakthrough is at a rate of $400 .</seg>
<seg id=1>i believe that the business is very busy in the past year .</seg>
<seg id=1>indeed , the practice of the city is also the result of the achievements of the gold and silver industry .</seg>
<seg id=1>these efforts contribute to the consolidation of hong kong 's position as a cornerstone for hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=1>the question is spring , and i hope that the trade field will continue to work in the coming year .</seg>
<seg id=1>i am confident that , following the active efforts of the industry , hong kong people will be able to put their heads in the market .</seg>
<seg id=1>finally , i wish to UNK the gold and gold business of the UNK city , which flourished and flourished .</seg>
<seg id=1>thank you .</seg>
<seg id=1>however , the challenge for the past is more than the provision of private housing .</seg>
<seg id=1>the bursting of the asset bubble in 1997 led to the collapse of the asset bubble , which caused the owners to hit the market by seven years .</seg>
<seg id=1>we are determined to maintain a stable environment to ensure steady and sound development of the property market .</seg>
<seg id=1>the healthy property market is indeed vital to the continued recovery of hong kong 's economy .</seg>
<seg id=1>we are also committed to protecting and improving our environment .</seg>
<seg id=1>we will strengthen the protection of the natural and cultural relics in hong kong to improve the living environment .</seg>
<seg id=1>we will pay more attention to the general environment .</seg>
<seg id=1>last year , the lessons of sars in hong kong warned us that we must focus on the creation of a more spacious and healthy housing environment .</seg>
<seg id=1>we will strengthen the preservation of the environment , the green trees , the enhancement of parks and recreational facilities , and the convenience of the public .</seg>
<seg id=1>i hereby wish to express my gratitude to the members for their views on the chief executive 's policy address related to the administration , the law , the civil service , the civil service and the UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>it is only members of the judiciary and the judiciary who are the chairman and vicechairmen of the legislative and legislative council .</seg>
<seg id=1>the chief executive puts forward measures to promote the government 's policies , including strengthening of the principal officials and society , the enhancement of public policy research and the strengthening of the</seg>
<seg id=1>the department is fully engaged in the above efforts to ensure that all measures taken by the government are consistent with the basic law , especially to safeguard the basic rights and freedoms of the</seg>
<seg id=1>as the principal official , i will strive to understand the views of the public and the legal community over matters affecting the judiciary and the legal profession .</seg>
<seg id=1>the arrangement for closer economic ties in the mainland , for instance , is the outcome of the close cooperation between the government and the industry , including the UNK , the bar and china .</seg>
<seg id=1>we have successfully established the legal services in the arrangement as one of the most open service sectors in the mainland .</seg>
<seg id=1>the role of the task force is twoway , and we will be reminded of the work of the public in hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=1>from january to this year , we have visited more than ten groups and men .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is the only one country , two systems for the development of hong kong , which is the central government .</seg>
<seg id=1>most of them believe that hong kong 's political system needs to be improved ; at the same time , the basic law would be accepted .</seg>
<seg id=1>the group and people also have their opinions about individual processes and the legal problems .</seg>
<seg id=1>the task force will be in the centre of their respective will .</seg>
<seg id=1>over the next month , the task force will continue to be able to meet other groups and people .</seg>
<seg id=1>this is only the first meeting between the task force and the central authorities .</seg>
<seg id=1>i am convinced that the development of the political system is related to the relations between the central and the hksar , and the central committee will also look into the constitutional provision of the development of the UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>the west kowloon heritage district is the major cultural heritage programme in hong kong , not just to provide the public with the cultural and leisure space .</seg>
<seg id=1>the kowloon heritage district is the hong kong society as a whole .</seg>
<seg id=1>the government must keep abreast of the various circles of the society .</seg>
<seg id=1>we understand that we can not only seek the integrity of the building , but also enable it to achieve economic benefits and to achieve sustainable development and to raise the people 's quality of life .</seg>
<seg id=1>the government attaches great importance to the development of the software package in the west kowloon cultural heritage district .</seg>
<seg id=1>the preparation of these strategies must be carefully listening to the views of the family .</seg>
<seg id=1>the young generation , including every young friend you sit , is one of the most important contributors to the west kowloon cultural heritage .</seg>
<seg id=1>we hope that this area can be seen in the region , and whether the people of hong kong or the people of hong kong , who are still alive , can be UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>i know that you have held this morning to discuss the several different areas of the kowloon cultural heritage district .</seg>
<seg id=1>i am not too eager to listen to the results of your discussion and to exchange ideas with you .</seg>
<seg id=1>after the sept . 11 terrorist attacks , global attention is focused on ports , airports and border security .</seg>
<seg id=1>as the first port for global transport to the us , hong kong is undoubtedly a speedy return to the proposed port safety initiative .</seg>
<seg id=1>in addition , we believe that the closure of the life line of the terrorist organization is an effective instrument for suppressing terrorist activities .</seg>
<seg id=1>the large sums of money flowing through the global financial system have been UNK by the law enforcement agencies in charge of crime .</seg>
<seg id=1>as the main financial centre of asia , we believe that the UNK of terrorists may be the most UNK way to UNK the structure .</seg>
<seg id=1>the legislation bodies in hong kong are currently discussing the improvement proposals to tighten up the current legislation against terrorist terrorist activities and to actively cooperate with the international standards and the</seg>
<seg id=1>in addition , we are seeking information disclosure legislation for reporting suspicious transactions regarding institutions and persons concerned .</seg>
<seg id=1>the balance is also the key to the work : the efficient investigation of powers , the freedom of personal privacy , the economic and financial system , as well as the efficiency of individual private , economic and financial systems .</seg>
<seg id=1>our control is based on the rule of law , transparency , equity and efficiency .</seg>
<seg id=1>as a matter of fact , the service sector in hong kong has an advantage over the past .</seg>
<seg id=1>hong kong 's professional and business service professionals have a deeper understanding of the business operations of the international and mainland .</seg>
<seg id=1>hong kong 's accounting , financial , legal and arbitration services are the best partners for the mainland to compete in the world market .</seg>
<seg id=1>as for the services of transportation , construction , design and marketing , management consultancy , information technology , and information technology , and information technology and exhibitions and exhibitions , will help enhance the overall productivity and competitiveness of the chinese</seg>
<seg id=1>as well as tourism , medical and insurance services , we will also help drive forward the development of the related markets and sectors in the mainland to improve the service level .</seg>
<seg id=1>the UNK services will greatly enhance their respective strengths and contribute to the opportunities and challenges posed by the economic globalization .</seg>
<seg id=1>in order to promote the development of the professional services sector in the mainland , the financial secretary and i , as well as representatives from relevant departments and departments in the region , will conduct substantive and UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>i am very happy to have an important step towards the development of the mainland market , respectively .</seg>
<seg id=1>through the meeting , the hong kong professional bodies also established closer ties with the mainland authorities to provide a sound basis for the friendly cooperation in the next phase .</seg>
<seg id=1>i believe that most of hong kong citizens are loved to be loved , hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=1>the relations between the mainland and hong kong in the economic , social , political and cultural fields are closely related .</seg>
<seg id=1>on the economic front , we have seen the expansion of the four modernizations since the 20 years of the effort to reform the country .</seg>
<seg id=1>we have taken further opportunities to achieve closer economic and trade ties with the central government .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the development of society , we have witnessed in recent years the national development .</seg>
<seg id=1>hong kong people looking for the successful bid of the beijing 2008 olympic games .</seg>
<seg id=1>why did the hong kong people come into hong kong a few months ago , when the hong kong people visited hong kong</seg>
<seg id=1>because we feel that china can have this achievement , we feel proud to be proud of everyone and hong kong people .</seg>
<seg id=1>i am aware that the legislative council , starting from 10 years ago , started to discuss the longterm office of the legislative council .</seg>
<seg id=1>similarly , the government has been considering the longterm plan to UNK government offices over the past decade .</seg>
<seg id=1>i am therefore aware that the decision by the government to expedite the development of the UNK in the new legislative council is disappointed .</seg>
<seg id=1>i understand that parliamentarians will continue to work in difficult circumstances .</seg>
<seg id=1>however , as i said to the government colleague that was affected by that decision , it was hoped that all would also be able to take the public interest in the matter , to understand the situation and to keep up with patience .</seg>
<seg id=1>i have briefed the council on the administration of the legislative council many times that the government is not at the right time to take into consideration the current financial situation and the financial situation of the UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>the construction of the new legislative council building in UNK would help to reduce the financial pressure of the government for the coming years and to be acceptable to the public .</seg>
<seg id=1>the government will further improve the construction of the new legislative council , the new legislative council , to do so .</seg>
<seg id=1>the state is very concerned about hong kong , chairman and premier , and i know that they and the central government will do everything possible to do their work .</seg>
<seg id=1>therefore , the good news will be coming from tourism , finance , infrastructure coordination , UNK and services .</seg>
<seg id=1>i also wish to hope that hong kong will be able to make greater contributions to the development of the economy with the economic recovery in hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=1>while i meet with premier wen jiabao , we also represent the city 's success in his very difficult year .</seg>
<seg id=1>premier wen jiabao also said to me that mr. deng xiaoping 's important exposition of the two systems in one country two years ago is of great significance and will contribute to the development of the future .</seg>
<seg id=1>he also spoke to me about the real need to take up this opportunity , concentrating on the development of the economy and benefiting people .</seg>
<seg id=1>i will come to meet with mr. UNK , the secretary of the guangdong provincial bureau of guangdong , mr. UNK UNK and the governor of the province .</seg>
<seg id=1>the last point is the UNK UNK , which is to train hong kong as the main body .</seg>
<seg id=1>as to the patriots , it is the patriotic people who want to respect themselves and to the country and to hong kong .</seg>
<seg id=1>i would like to reiterate that the hong kong people of hong kong are patriotic .</seg>
<seg id=1>this is not the hong kong people , but a person who is involved in the management of hong kong public matters and is a senior citizen of the executive framework , the legislative council and the judiciary .</seg>
<seg id=1>they were sworn in the basic law and the hong kong special administrative region as the hong kong special administrative region .</seg>
<seg id=1>the five principles of the five , six principles and the important issues i have spoken have been formulated since the beginning of the 1980s .</seg>
<seg id=1>the establishment of intellectual property rights for several hundred years , especially the industrial revolution , has created an important invention of great significance .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the past two decades , the intellectual property system has played an important role in the promotion of the basic legal system and policy instruments for promoting innovation in technology .</seg>
<seg id=1>at present , with the rapid development of science and economy , the creation , occupation and application of knowledge and intellectual resources have become an important part of the international competition .</seg>
<seg id=1>hence , international exchange and cooperation in strengthening ipr protection is of great significance to the establishment of a just and equitable international economic order and the promotion of world economic prosperity and development .</seg>
<seg id=1>the chinese government attaches great importance to the protection of intellectual property rights .</seg>
<seg id=1>at the beginning of the reform and opening up of china , the intellectual property rights system was established .</seg>
<seg id=1>the 21st century mankind enters the information society , and the revolutionary revolution will push forward the development of the social productive forces unprecedented .</seg>
<seg id=1>we should further improve the system of intellectual property rights in our country , strengthen the international exchange and cooperation in the work of ipr protection .</seg>
<seg id=1>we are willing to work hard for the establishment of a just and rational understanding of intellectual property rights and the good environment for ipr protection .</seg>
<seg id=1>the acceleration of the sco is the first priority of the shanghai cooperation organization .</seg>
<seg id=1>thanks to the efforts of the efforts , the preparations for the secretariat and the regional antiterrorism institutions have made considerable progress .</seg>
<seg id=1>we should make persistent efforts to ensure the formal launch of the secretariat in the year and early establishment of regional antiterrorism institutions .</seg>
<seg id=1>in order to reflect the high attention to the shanghai cooperation organization , the chinese government decided to provide the secretariat with the office free for the secretariat .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the future , we will continue to support the smooth implementation of the secretariat .</seg>
<seg id=1>to deepen and expand security cooperation has always been the focus of the shanghai cooperation organization .</seg>
<seg id=1>we must not let down our guard and be more vulnerable to the three evil forces which have endangered the interests of the member states .</seg>
<seg id=1>we should take longterm and unremitting efforts to wipe out the evil forces and safeguard stability and stability in the region .</seg>
<seg id=1>in order to remove the financial resources of the activity of the three evil forces , we should attack the issue of the conflict as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=1>economic cooperation is an important basis and priority direction of the shanghai cooperation organization .</seg>
<seg id=1>the education is the cornerstone of the modern civilization .</seg>
<seg id=1>we must accelerate the development of the education cause by enhancing the national qualities and strengthening the overall national strength .</seg>
<seg id=1>the impact of rural education is extensive and the overall situation of rural economy and social development is concerned .</seg>
<seg id=1>since the reform and opening up , the countryside and rural areas have undergone tremendous changes , especially the education of the rural education .</seg>
<seg id=1>the rural household contract responsibility system has been greatly liberated and the productive forces have been greatly liberated .</seg>
<seg id=1>the basic reason is that there are hundreds of millions of rural laborers in the countryside .</seg>
<seg id=1>at present , the agriculture and rural economy of our country is in the midst of the most important stages .</seg>
<seg id=1>the rise of the new science and technology and the promotion of the overall construction of the welloff society .</seg>
<seg id=1>without the overall development of the general UNK of the rural , and without the overall improvement of farmers ' quality , we will be very hard to achieve a comprehensive sense of prosperity .</seg>
<seg id=1>we must fully understand the fundamental , guiding and overall role of rural education in an allround way .</seg>
<seg id=1>the consultants and guests of the participating countries , renowned senior leaders of prominent multinational companies , have eminent experts of international economic experts .</seg>
<seg id=1>i am deeply aware of the spirit and constructive attitude of the advisers to the full cooperation of the consultants .</seg>
<seg id=1>giving full play to our spirit of cooperation and collective wisdom is not only to design and promote the development of guangdong , but also to contribute to the common promotion of cooperation and development in all areas .</seg>
<seg id=1>i have always looked forward to the UNK of 2003 , and listening and understanding of you for the development of the guangdong economy .</seg>
<seg id=1>we are here today to be a shared goal : strengthen our cooperation and exchanges , expand development space , and create opportunities for your cause .</seg>
<seg id=1>china 's accession to the wto represents the opening up to a new stage , and we are engaged in international competition on greater scale , wider areas and more .</seg>
<seg id=1>guangdong is the UNK province of the chinese mainland , which has taken the lead of unprecedented development opportunities and challenges .</seg>
<seg id=1>against such backdrop , we must seize the new opportunities , meet the new challenges , meet the new challenges , and strive to advance the modernization process .</seg>
<seg id=1>the chinese people are actively building a moderately prosperous society in an allround way .</seg>
<seg id=1>the guangdong economy , which is full of vitality and broad prospects , is moving towards the new high .</seg>
<seg id=1>recently , the iraqi interim management committee and the united states authorities announced an agreement in baghdad to announce a gradual step by the end of june .</seg>
<seg id=1>the agreement was endorsed by the international community , while the meeting expressed the view that the process was too slow to be considered by the united nations in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=1>the iraqi people responded ; america 's opinion was even thought it was a big gamble .</seg>
<seg id=1>in short , there is a way to look at the mood of the people .</seg>
<seg id=1>the international community doubts as much as that .</seg>
<seg id=1>because it was not clear that the united states was not UNK , the surrender of power would not be possible , and there would be many UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>first , the interim transitional government to be established next may not be elected directly by the iraqi people , but the election of the transitional national congress elected by 18 provincial elections .</seg>
<seg id=1>it would be difficult to evade the UNK of the united states , which could be questioned .</seg>
<seg id=1>secondly , the united states has announced that the united states does not withdraw , but that it is only to turn the military occupation into military affairs .</seg>
<seg id=1>the government announced on 18 november that it was decided to impose quotas on three kinds of textiles , UNK and UNK imported from china .</seg>
<seg id=1>as china continues to expand its efforts to expand the bilateral trade and economic cooperation , the protectionist measures of the us government are not UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>the development of the economic globalization is very UNK to the readjustment of american textile imports .</seg>
<seg id=1>first , the UNK measures limit the implementation of the wto 's free trade principles .</seg>
<seg id=1>on the one hand , it is not too arbitrary and fair to talk about the right to free trade and to UNK UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>secondly , the limit of limits limits the sound development momentum of chinaus economic and trade relations .</seg>
<seg id=1>the us export rose 15 per cent to china since the agreement reached the wto agreement in 1999 .</seg>
<seg id=1>china 's exports to china rose by UNK per cent in the first nine months of the year .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the past two years , the us textile material and manufactured goods have risen sharply .</seg>
<seg id=1>indeed , today china has become the world 's fastest growing country for world exports .</seg>
<seg id=1>before the end of the cold war , the united states became the only superpower in the world .</seg>
<seg id=1>the united states is not authorized by the united nations to launch the war in iraq and to refrain from the major international issues such as the reconstruction of iraq .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to a poll released by the european commission , the european commission said that 68 percent believed the united states would not be fully justified by the u.s. war .</seg>
<seg id=1>second , the united states emphasizes that it is to be willing to contribute to the allies , while the issues of concern to them are not UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>for the first time , the united states has made it clear that the united states is willing to make concessions .</seg>
<seg id=1>third , the united states values the values of democracy in the middle east , and advocates that the united states will respect islamic countries .</seg>
<seg id=1>however , president bush is defending his iraqi policy during his visit , stressing that u.s. forces will continue to take measures against violence in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=1>now that mr bush is unsuccessful , the situation in iraq is not likely to die like the white house hopes .</seg>
<seg id=1>after the controversy over the last six months , the japanese selfdefense forces have finally UNK to iraq by the end of 2003 .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is the first time that japan has sent troops to the overseas field after the end of world war ii .</seg>
<seg id=1>it reflects the will of japan to the political and military powers , as well as the transformation of japanese defense .</seg>
<seg id=1>the reason for the UNK is that it is not an isolated incident .</seg>
<seg id=1>by the end of the year , the autonomous region has successfully established diplomatic relations with the united states , and by the end of the year , the cpc central committee promulgated the</seg>
<seg id=1>the further step , however , broke out the restriction of the japanese peace constitution and achieved the military field of troops .</seg>
<seg id=1>in addition , japan is prepared to revise the basic defence forces in 2004 , so as to UNK the law of overseas troops .</seg>
<seg id=1>at the same time , the japanese cabinet made the decision to start the missile defense system at the beginning of 2004 .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is difficult to see that the japanese air force is moving towards the regular pace of the armed forces , while the socalled selfdefence force of the socalled UNK selfdefense force would be UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>the cause of japan 's actions is the first reason because these military decisions are a shock to the japanese peace constitution .</seg>
<seg id=1>koizumi , after visiting yasukuni , was interviewed by japanese journalists and defended his actions .</seg>
<seg id=1>the word is contradictory , and the secret of the word is UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>the reporter asked if mr. koizumi would visit , and that the japanese peace and prosperity were achieved on the basis of the UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>i have been visiting the country to pray for peace and prosperity in japan .</seg>
<seg id=1>whether the UNK of the war , too , will also be the UNK war criminals .</seg>
<seg id=1>the postwar japanese occupation of peace and prosperity , as well as the basis of the class a war criminals</seg>
<seg id=1>q : why have you chosen to visit yasukuni shrine on january 1</seg>
<seg id=1>mr koizumi said that the first day of the year was the tradition of japan and many people visited the shrine .</seg>
<seg id=1>we can understand that they visit yasukuni shrine , which is only a tribute to the yasukuni shrine .</seg>
<seg id=1>as far as the chinese people are concerned , we have always maintained that the people of japan and the minority have separated the ordinary people from the right .</seg>
<seg id=1>unity is strength .</seg>
<seg id=1>it was the truth of the truth that it was the truth of the truth .</seg>
<seg id=1>to achieve the grand goal of building a moderately prosperous society in an allround way , we must unite all our efforts to achieve the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation .</seg>
<seg id=1>the work of the patriotic united front and the people 's political consultative conference in the new phase must be based on the fundamental starting point and the end .</seg>
<seg id=1>we need to further consolidate and improve the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the chinese communist party .</seg>
<seg id=1>over the past year , the cppcc has made great efforts to grasp the two themes of unity and democracy , seriously fulfill various functions and play an important role in promoting the overall development of the economy and the</seg>
<seg id=1>in the new year , the people 's political consultative conference held close attention to the cpc and the central work , and made great contributions to the building of good traditions .</seg>
<seg id=1>on 4 and 6 january , the twelfth summit of the south asian association for regional cooperation ( saarc ) was to be held in islamabad .</seg>
<seg id=1>during the UNK summit , india 's prime minister UNK UNK and pakistan 's bilateral meetings were notable .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the last summit , mr. musharraf shook hands with UNK and did not have many expectations for the development of bilateral ties .</seg>
<seg id=1>two years later , the issue of UNK relations and the realization of the UNK region have achieved the highest level of meetings by the two sides of the talks .</seg>
<seg id=1>the two countries have further advanced in the process of improving bilateral ties and the regional cooperation in south asia faces a new turn .</seg>
<seg id=1>although indian foreign minister UNK UNK said on thursday the meeting was UNK , the talks mean that the talks mean that india 's relations will continue to adjust to more active and pragmatic terms .</seg>
<seg id=1>the leaders of the two countries have realized that tensions and confrontation do not accord with the domestic interests , while the opportunity for economic development is lost .</seg>
<seg id=1>with the further development of the global economy , it is imperative to strengthen the cooperation and revitalize the economy .</seg>
<seg id=1>although the results of the presidential elections in georgia have not been officially declared , the UNK UNK of the rightwing political party and the race party leader UNK UNK have been established .</seg>
<seg id=1>seven days after the central electoral commission announced that , according to statistics of 89 per cent of the vote , more than 95% of voters supported UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>some of the UNK countries have also given the young statesman the congratulatory message .</seg>
<seg id=1>in fact , on the evening of the election , UNK had declared himself a victory .</seg>
<seg id=1>he called the result the people 's victory and said georgia would act quickly to create a new future .</seg>
<seg id=1>most voters told the news media that the vote to UNK implies a new hope .</seg>
<seg id=1>even UNK , who was forced to resign , expressed support for the old UNK , saying it was young , energetic and welleducated .</seg>
<seg id=1>at the same time , people have noticed that the situation in georgia has not changed during the last two months of mr. UNK 's resignation .</seg>
<seg id=1>it can be said that the newly elected president will face the problem of the old question .</seg>
<seg id=1>the past year is an important and extraordinary year in the development process of our country .</seg>
<seg id=1>china , the united nations and the united nations in china have made rapid progress in the chinese nation .</seg>
<seg id=1>remarkable achievements have been made by the people throughout the country , and the people of the whole country have made tremendous efforts to this end .</seg>
<seg id=1>looking forward to the new year , we are full of confidence and hope .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the face of the international situation , we are in the process of maintaining an important strategic opportunity which must be tightly seized and can excel .</seg>
<seg id=1>we should adhere to the principles of deng xiaoping and the important thoughts of the three represents , and earnestly implement the central committee 's principles and overall plans for this year .</seg>
<seg id=1>in doing so , we need to properly grasp the situation , so as to see the conditions and the new opportunities and strengthen the sense of sense , urgency and suffering .</seg>
<seg id=1>on 19 march at the united nations headquarters in new york , u . n . secretarygeneral kofi annan and the representative of the united nations interim authority of the united nations interim authority conducted consultations .</seg>
<seg id=1>the talks involved iraq 's political , humane , security and the appointment of the united nations special representative in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=1>the united nations is truly visible and how the united nations is involved in the reconstruction of iraq .</seg>
<seg id=1>since the united states announced the end of the major war in iraq in may last year , the situation in iraq remains unsettled and the number of attacks on the occupation of the united states has been UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>the former president of saddam hussein , 13 december , opened on 13 december , but the united states was not in good shape .</seg>
<seg id=1>on the other hand , the iraqi people and arab countries unanimously agreed that the withdrawal of the troops of other countries would be required .</seg>
<seg id=1>at the same time , the united states is trying to rebuild the iraqi regime in the light of its own will and on that basis gradually UNK it .</seg>
<seg id=1>to this end , the mode and process of transferring power is the focus of the current iraqi affair .</seg>
<seg id=1>as envisaged in november 1 , the current transitional government of the united states and the united nations will be elected by the provisional transitional government .</seg>
<seg id=1>while most of the population of the population is stressed , it is important to hold the general election directly .</seg>
<seg id=1>secretary of state powell 's visit to russia today is still a focus of public opinion .</seg>
<seg id=1>that aspect is due to the great significance of the two countries .</seg>
<seg id=1>more importantly , the UNK of moscow is rich in substance and conveyed a clear signal : the beauty of the relations between russia and the united states .</seg>
<seg id=1>if the shadow UNK , the prospect of the relations will become bleak .</seg>
<seg id=1>while the channels for dialogue between washington and moscow were UNK , powell decided to explain his position in the UNK of the UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the article , powell pointed out that the united states had confused the series of incidents in the country 's internal affairs and diplomacy .</seg>
<seg id=1>he believed that the russian regime had not fully accepted the legal constraints , and the key elements of the civil society such as freedom and development were not strong .</seg>
<seg id=1>the policies that russia is pursuing in chechnya and its attitude towards the commonwealth of independent states are more to us fears .</seg>
<seg id=1>the UNK appears to be the last UNK of communicating information through the mass media .</seg>
<seg id=1>the united states has made the most of its choice to the united states , and russia is embarrassed and UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>the rise of the u.s. influenza virus in the united states reached its peak .</seg>
<seg id=1>on wednesday 31 , xinhua news agency , los angeles , said that the u.s. disease control and prevention center ( UNK ) of the united states reached its peak , with 45 years of the united states .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to the statistics , on 20 december , the death toll from the united states has accounted for UNK of all deaths in the same period .</seg>
<seg id=1>there are at least 42 children killed in the united states , while the death toll is increasing , but it is not yet to be accurately measured .</seg>
<seg id=1>experts believe that the influenza virus had two reasons : the first flu virus , which was not prevalent in the previous years .</seg>
<seg id=1>while the united states is dying for more than UNK deaths per year , UNK people have been hospitalized because of the flu .</seg>
<seg id=1>william thompson , an american expert , said the flu was the most serious in nearly 30 years , and the flu epidemic occurred in many schools .</seg>
<seg id=1>facing such a grim situation , the american health ministry launched the emergency treatment centre on 19 december and sent medical experts to the states .</seg>
<seg id=1>recently , the chinese parts of our country have been witnessing highly pathogenic avian influenza .</seg>
<seg id=1>the cpc central committee and the state council attach great importance to this issue , and make a series of major decisions promptly to put forward guidelines and measures for the prevention and treatment .</seg>
<seg id=1>all relevant localities and departments have made urgent actions to prevent the spread of the epidemic according to the arrangement of the party central committee and the state council .</seg>
<seg id=1>at present , the whole country is engaged in an orderly and orderly manner .</seg>
<seg id=1>highly pathogenic avian influenza is an animal epidemic which spreads fast , endanger the production of the animal and seriously endanger the people 's health and safety .</seg>
<seg id=1>in accordance with the law of the people 's republic of china on the law of the people 's republic of china for the prevention and control of the disease , the central government and the department of the</seg>
<seg id=1>as the world 's largest debtor , the amount of external debt of the united states is increasing .</seg>
<seg id=1>the us treasury announced on 16 january that , as of the end of september , the us owed to foreign creditors amounting to UNK bn , up 2.2 per cent compared with the previous one .</seg>
<seg id=1>on the average , each american has more than 20,000 yuan of external debt .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the past week , the international monetary fund ( imf ) warned that the financial foundations of the united states would be alert to the financial foundations of the united states .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to statistics , foreign private investors have been able to take over 40 per cent of u.s. government bonds .</seg>
<seg id=1>this is an association of the first half of the 20th century by keynesian president roosevelt : domestic deficit policy stimulus economy , and fiscal UNK should be settled through foreign debt .</seg>
<seg id=1>that would have played an important role in overcoming the UNK of the economic crisis .</seg>
<seg id=1>however , americans have seen that the united states government has preferred to be a UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>but the fiscal deficit in the united states has gradually increased since the 1980s , and finally turned into the biggest debtor .</seg>
<seg id=1>the convening of the talks is an important step taken in the peaceful settlement process of the dprk nuclear issue .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the meeting , some common points formed by the members of the talks have been established to lay the necessary basis for the talks and to further remove the goals , ways and principles of the peninsula nuclear issue .</seg>
<seg id=1>over the past few months , the parties concerned have been committed to the peaceful solution of the korean peninsula nuclear issue and , on the basis of the outcome of the talks , the UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>at the same time , the united states further demonstrated the degree of flexibility .</seg>
<seg id=1>progress has been made in the preparations for the talks , and the talks are the UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>the second round of talks can achieve tangible results , and whether the talks will be kept by the talks , will be shared by all concerned and the international community .</seg>
<seg id=1>in response , the chinese foreign ministry spokesman said that the goal of the sixparty talks was to keep and promote a peaceful settlement process .</seg>
<seg id=1>china 's basic departure is to safeguard peace and stability on the korean peninsula and achieve denuclearization on the peninsula .</seg>
<seg id=1>china believes that , as long as the parties uphold and discuss sincerity , mutual respect and consultation , the chinese side can create favorable conditions for promoting the settlement of the issues .</seg>
<seg id=1>the relationship between the united states and the united states was deteriorating in the end of the 1970s .</seg>
<seg id=1>the president of the united states , president ronald reagan , outlined a long series of crimes , such as accusing the secret development of the nuclear weapons , and military interference and terrorism .</seg>
<seg id=1>the two sides had UNK to UNK , and the united states launched two surgical attacks on the UNK and the gold canyon .</seg>
<seg id=1>since then , the united states imposed sanctions on the economy , and politically , politically , and politically .</seg>
<seg id=1>but the UNK under the stress of the stress is not yielding .</seg>
<seg id=1>for now , the warming of the relationship is due to the deterrent effect of the war in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=1>in fact , over the years , with the UNK of the united states and the united states , the other has been UNK to the united states .</seg>
<seg id=1>after the end of the war in iraq , the parties in the middle east adjust to the strategy and the reconstruction of the region .</seg>
<seg id=1>to the republic of china , the united states should be able to conclude the sanctions , reinvigorate the economy , improve the people 's livelihood , and shake off the isolation and integration of the international community .</seg>
<seg id=1>UNK offers something that has not yet been received and can be changed to another village .</seg>
<seg id=1>from 27 to 8 february , political leaders from the united states and the rest of the world converged in munich to attend the fortieth munich security policy meeting .</seg>
<seg id=1>the socalled munich security conference was established , supported by the german government , and has been attracted to the attention of the german government in recent years .</seg>
<seg id=1>one of the most important issues of the meeting is the transatlantic relations .</seg>
<seg id=1>the comments made by the european and european diplomats suggest that the two sides are struggling to shake off the shadow of the iraqi war and push back to the path of cooperation .</seg>
<seg id=1>the director of the berlin international and security institute said that this was a meeting of the united states and the united states .</seg>
<seg id=1>for the united states and the united states , the new information is that the us and europe need to reconsider , and to find serious consideration of the shared responsibilities of the two sides and to find the UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>at last year 's meeting , the UNK of the meeting disappeared , and the positions were close .</seg>
<seg id=1>while the war in which the united states was waging war on behalf of the united states , it was said to have seen the united states .</seg>
<seg id=1>although we have different views on the war , we must work together to ensure that the postwar peace of iraq is to be seen , we have to view it , said german foreign minister UNK UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>he also said that germany would not block nato 's direct role in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the united states , which has been held in the field of modern media , it has long been a monopoly .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is to be able to provide a comprehensive and just UNK platform to the arab countries , said mr. UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>but analysts pointed out that the freedom issue will be the united states strategic weapon for the penetration of public opinion against the arab countries , cultural invasion and UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>it appears that the mission is the mission of the freedom no .</seg>
<seg id=1>the united states believes that the islamic civilization is a serious obstacle to the development of modern cultures in the west .</seg>
<seg id=1>the united states is trying to UNK the ideology of its ideology to the arabs by the subtle effect of the UNK programme .</seg>
<seg id=1>second , improving the image of the united states .</seg>
<seg id=1>the united states is committed to UNK , and in a series of international issues , the practice of hong kong and the islamic world is UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>9. since the september 11 incident , the contradiction between the united states of israel and the middle east is UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>the united states resorted to the removal of the weapons of mass destruction and the fight against terrorism without certain evidence and the united nations mandate .</seg>
<seg id=1>the talks of pakistan and india were held in islamabad on 16 and 18 february , and the hope of peace rose again in the south asia subcontinent .</seg>
<seg id=1>the two sides established the agenda and the mode of the talks and established the mechanism for continuing dialogue , which marked the beginning of the resumption of the talks .</seg>
<seg id=1>before the meeting , the relationship between the two countries was much more cautious in the prospects for the peace process , despite the UNK of goodwill played by both sides .</seg>
<seg id=1>this is not surprising , as seen in recent years the UNK of UNK relations , and there are no guarantees : the sunshine to the negotiating table today will not be UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>however , mr. UNK UNK , secretary for foreign affairs of the republic of pakistan , opened the sound of optimism to the sound of optimism .</seg>
<seg id=1>first , the timetable set out in the meeting is highly workable , and the two sides have not only identified specific meeting time and issues but also on the basis of their respective UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>secondly , the two sides learned that the talks between the leaders of the two countries led to the failure of the talks .</seg>
<seg id=1>once again , the two countries have experienced many UNK of bilateral relations , and the war is not the best way to resolve the dispute .</seg>
<seg id=1>to thoroughly understand and implement the principle of one country , two systems , we must unify the country and the two systems , to respect hong kong 's high degree of autonomy and the</seg>
<seg id=1>only then will they be able to protect the wellbeing of hong kong people in the long run .</seg>
<seg id=1>since the return of hong kong , the central government has faithfully implemented the principle of one country , two systems and strictly in accordance with the basic law .</seg>
<seg id=1>the people of hong kong enjoy an unprecedented democratic right in the position of the masters .</seg>
<seg id=1>with the strong support from the central government and the mainland , hong kong has continued to maintain the international financial , trade and maritime centre .</seg>
<seg id=1>the practice has proved that the policy of one country , two systems has powerful vitality .</seg>
<seg id=1>deng xiaoping 's remarks reached two decades ago , and his strong determination to implement the policy of one country , two systems is being put forward .</seg>
<seg id=1>today , the central committee of the communist party of china and the state council solemnly held the national congress on science and technology .</seg>
<seg id=1>president hu jintao gave the award of the UNK and UNK of the UNK countries .</seg>
<seg id=1>the national convention for china manned space program was awarded by the general assembly for the project of manned space engineering and the national science and technology project</seg>
<seg id=1>on behalf of the central committee of the communist party of china and the state council , i would like to congratulate all the winners .</seg>
<seg id=1>sincere greetings and noble respect to the scientific and technical personnel of the united front</seg>
<seg id=1>in the first 20 years of this century , it is an important strategic opportunity to UNK and to excel .</seg>
<seg id=1>we need to focus on building a welloff society in an allround way to the highest level of the population .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is necessary to put forward the development of the development of science and technology .</seg>
<seg id=1>after the sept . 11 , president bush broke out preemptive strategy in june 2002 and put in practice in the united states .</seg>
<seg id=1>the UNK concept is not only UNK with the principles of mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity as well as the risk effect of UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the early days of the UNK theory , some u.s. politicians put forward some of the questions : ' if other countries follow what they can .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the past two years , the number of countries that claims to be UNK have increased , and the number of UNK teams is expanding .</seg>
<seg id=1>this is a new trend of attention and research .</seg>
<seg id=1>australia 's prime minister howard howard first stood out for his support in the month of the UNK strategy .</seg>
<seg id=1>he said that if the terrorists were to have the reliable intelligence to attack australia , australia would take preemptive preemptive strategy and take military action on the outskirts .</seg>
<seg id=1>he even proposed that the UNK principle be included in the united nations charter and that it would be necessary to change the united nations charter to the united nations</seg>
<seg id=1>in northeast asia , the ministry of defense of japan launched the defense paper , which was released in july 1999 by the japanese defense agency .</seg>
<seg id=1>after the war of iraq , the call for the preemptive strategy was more powerful .</seg>
<seg id=1>recently , the current african policy review of the united states has been quite recent .</seg>
<seg id=1>the foreign policy of the united states , published in january , published the agenda for the 2004 african policy .</seg>
<seg id=1>it was also recalled that the bush administration established the president in january last year to provide assistance to africa .</seg>
<seg id=1>last july , president bush visited the african countries of senegal , south africa , botswana , uganda and nigeria to fight hiv / aids .</seg>
<seg id=1>those assistance plans , which had been welcomed by the african countries , have also won many acclaim internationally .</seg>
<seg id=1>however , the specific actions of the united states over the past year have not been delayed .</seg>
<seg id=1>there is an urgent need for africa to need assistance in africa .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the new century , africa has been confronted with various development challenges , and efforts to achieve the development goals of the united nations in the year 2000 , the african UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>the united nations has called for the developed countries to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product to the ldcs .</seg>
<seg id=1>but the us official aid is just 0.1% of gross domestic product and is far from the united nations .</seg>
<seg id=1>the recent meeting between the UNK german chancellor , french president chirac , and british prime minister tony blair has recently been discussed .</seg>
<seg id=1>the three powers will be called the three UNK , which is called the new triangle .</seg>
<seg id=1>the new triangle is a new thing , and it is still not seen from the angle of view .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the european history , the basic feature of the relation between the UNK and the UNK is that the british law is governed by law .</seg>
<seg id=1>the two world wars proved to be in the last world war .</seg>
<seg id=1>during the cold war , two german UNK were held separately in UNK and UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>after the end of the cold war , the united states , after the end of the cold war , led to the collapse of the west german forces .</seg>
<seg id=1>but in recent years , with the restart of the axis of UNK and the fierce collisions between the world 's UNK and the multipolar concept , the eu has been in serious conflict .</seg>
<seg id=1>the UNK and the new europe represented by the german and polish are the opposite of the position of the war .</seg>
<seg id=1>the split is the biggest expansion in the face of the european union .</seg>
<seg id=1>the president of egypt , who today ( cairo ) , speaks of the reform of the arab countries , criticizing the practice of imposing a single model of reform in the arab countries and warned that such an attempt would be UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>he believed that reform measures should be carried out according to their respective traits , and the single mode of reform ignored the cultural background , social customs and religious characteristics of different countries .</seg>
<seg id=1>he also pointed out that in the process of the reform process , the arab countries welcomed foreign assistance , but such efforts should be seen to be aware of the different situations and respect of the wishes of the national</seg>
<seg id=1>the words of the egyptian leaders represented the common view of the arab countries .</seg>
<seg id=1>at present , under the pressure of antiterrorism , nonproliferation and democratic reform , the middle east as one of the hot spots in the middle east , the middle east is brewing new UNK and will lead to new integration .</seg>
<seg id=1>after world war in afghanistan and iraq , how the united states was seen as the axis of evil ?</seg>
<seg id=1>how to evolve across the various institutions and societies of the middle east</seg>
<seg id=1>it is not only the arab world and the international community , but also the us and its western allies .</seg>
<seg id=1>us secretary of state powell reiterated the united states to implement the western initiative on democracy and capitalism in iraq and the middle east after the us secretary of state powell met in washington on sunday .</seg>
<seg id=1>we are considering what we can do and how to make these systems , he added .</seg>
<seg id=1>last year , the international olympic committee was established as the year of culture and education .</seg>
<seg id=1>the organizing committee of the beijing olympic committee ( bocog ) has organized a series of educational activities to disseminate advanced culture and popularize the olympic knowledge .</seg>
<seg id=1>in particular , the publication of the olympic knowledge for the middle school students is a very important achievement .</seg>
<seg id=1>this book is devoted to the knowledge of the olympic movement and the essence of the spirit of the olympic spirit .</seg>
<seg id=1>last year , bocog also designed the UNK of the olympic emblem of the beijing olympic games .</seg>
<seg id=1>the concept of green olympics is to prepare and organize the olympic games with the sustainable development of environmental protection and ecological balance .</seg>
<seg id=1>we hope that the UNK will be able to regulate the behavior of young students , as well as UNK and UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>education is one of the core contents of the olympic movement , and also the important reflection of the UNK olympics .</seg>
<seg id=1>the real purpose of the olympic movement is to educate young people in a new angle and to promote the development of mental and harmonious development among young people .</seg>
<seg id=1>the combination of sport and education is not only new to the development of the education cause , but also the olympic movement .</seg>
<seg id=1>the green olympics is one of the three ideas of the beijing olympics .</seg>
<seg id=1>the core content is to improve the quality of the capital and create the ecological city for the olympic games .</seg>
<seg id=1>to this end , environmental governance , urban and rural afforestation and environmental protection should be promoted widely .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is an important task for us to implement the principle of comprehensive , coordinated and sustainable development and promote the allround , coordinated and sustainable development of the economy .</seg>
<seg id=1>we have to pay a great deal of attention .</seg>
<seg id=1>to achieve the goal of green olympic , the planning of olympic action and the planning of the ecological and environmental protection were formulated on the basis of the planning and the report .</seg>
<seg id=1>the goal of hosting a green olympics will be fully realized through planned and phased implementation .</seg>
<seg id=1>on february 25 , 2003 , the state council promulgated the report of the 2003 human rights report .</seg>
<seg id=1>of course , the state of the state of human rights is still certain , such as afghanistan and iraq , but that is the overthrow of the former regime , the liberation of the two countries .</seg>
<seg id=1>as for the situation of human rights in the united states ,</seg>
<seg id=1>the report , as in the previous years , is not to be put forward .</seg>
<seg id=1>on march 1 , 2003 , the state council information office published the 2003 united nations human rights record , which made up the deficiency of the united states human rights report .</seg>
<seg id=1>the author , based on the fact , introduces the problems existing in united states in human rights and the violation of the human rights of the united states .</seg>
<seg id=1>the united states has the tradition of honesty and integrity , and has the tradition of making mistakes .</seg>
<seg id=1>the story of the UNK of the cherry trees of george washington is an illustration illustration .</seg>
<seg id=1>today , the united states has become the only superpower in the world , rather than telling the truth .</seg>
<seg id=1>recently , the report on the development of the chinese economy has changed quietly .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to the former china UNK , many of japan 's reports are believed that the chinese economy has promoted recovery of the japanese economy , and the country 's brisk market demand has become an important impetus to the japanese economy .</seg>
<seg id=1>the united states news magazine recently said that china 's rise is an opportunity rather than a threat for other countries , especially neighbouring countries .</seg>
<seg id=1>the widely spread china UNK is replaced by the opportunity of china .</seg>
<seg id=1>china 's UNK assertion that china 's development will threaten china , especially neighbouring countries .</seg>
<seg id=1>that notion , however , was not accepted by the UNK of the country 's neighbors .</seg>
<seg id=1>malaysia 's prime minister , UNK UNK , said that the asian countries do not have to fear the growing military and economic strength of china because of the lack of the traditional tradition of conquering china .</seg>
<seg id=1>the ministry of defense of india also believes that china does not have military threat to india .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the trade and economy , governments and corporations both regard china as the best choice to expand the market .</seg>
<seg id=1>china is one of the world 's leading places in the world for a number of years .</seg>
<seg id=1>gdp is one of the most important macroeconomic indicators in the world .</seg>
<seg id=1>the growth of gdp in the whole process of the modernization drive is crucial .</seg>
<seg id=1>we have to keep the pace of rapid growth in the economy by taking up more than 80 million people .</seg>
<seg id=1>the ambitious goal and the realization of the third strategic goals for the construction of the welloff society will depend on the sustained rapid growth of gdp .</seg>
<seg id=1>we should see , however , that the gdp indicators also contain deficiencies .</seg>
<seg id=1>for instance , it is not easy to reflect the quality and structure of the economic growth , and it is not easy to reflect the actual social welfare level .</seg>
<seg id=1>on the other hand , gdp is not the only one .</seg>
<seg id=1>our achievements and achievements are not only the growth of the gdp but also the reality of the mass culture .</seg>
<seg id=1>therefore , we should use the scientific spirit , scientific attitude and the scientific approach to the current system of gdp .</seg>
<seg id=1>we should keep the growth rate of growth and not view too much .</seg>
<seg id=1>while the delegation of the council visited the six african countries in late june last year , the overall situation in the region had been encouraging .</seg>
<seg id=1>we are pleased to note that the government of sierra leone is making active progress towards the enhancement of the capabilities of the armed forces and police , the control of UNK diamond and the UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>it is also gratifying that , as the deployment of unomil , liberia is gradually moving away from the impact of prolonged wars and on the path to resume and rebuild .</seg>
<seg id=1>the political process in guineabissau has also achieved positive progress , and the transitional government has undertaken to hold legislative elections in march .</seg>
<seg id=1>the peace process in ce d ' ivoire has also occurred in the wake of some setbacks , with the commitment of the government to implement the UNK agreement .</seg>
<seg id=1>we look forward to the decision by the council as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=1>the secretariat , the ecowas and the parties concerned have also sought to address the border issue of small arms , mercenaries , child soldiers and to achieve positive results .</seg>
<seg id=1>in full recognition , we should see that the general situation in the west african region remains fragile , especially owing to the geopolitical and historical reasons , and that the countries of the region are in</seg>
<seg id=1>hence , as the council 's report recommends , the international community , including the council , must adhere to the comprehensive and comprehensive strategy to address the issue of the UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>we have a common understanding , and the children are the future of the world .</seg>
<seg id=1>we have the obligation to create the best and appropriate conditions for them , to make life and study so that they grow , maturation and success .</seg>
<seg id=1>regrettably , however , there were still hundreds of millions of children who were still suffering from armed conflicts .</seg>
<seg id=1>they experience unrest and backwardness , and they see violence and destruction , they are suffering from injury and abuse , and they feel sad and helpless .</seg>
<seg id=1>the protection of children from armed conflict is therefore an important duty of the international community .</seg>
<seg id=1>all countries , especially the parties to the conflict , should do the utmost to that end .</seg>
<seg id=1>we are pleased to see that , in recent years , the united nations has taken a series of measures to promote the protection of children in the field of armed conflict .</seg>
<seg id=1>the council has passed four resolutions , including UNK ( 1999 ) , UNK ( 2000 ) and UNK ( 2003 ) .</seg>
<seg id=1>the united nations peacekeeping operations in some regions have taken the protection of children as an important task , including the appointment of the child protection adviser to take full account of the special needs of children .</seg>
<seg id=1>the peace agreement that has been promoted or engaged in the united nations includes provisions protecting children .</seg>
<seg id=1>the national reconciliation is an important condition for the establishment of lasting peace and stability in the postconflict regions .</seg>
<seg id=1>if the conflict is stopped , and if the parties concerned cannot , the UNK UNK , the situation of the peace will be difficult to consolidate , and the flames of conflict may be UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>the realization of national reconciliation in many cases requires the joint efforts of the parties , as well as the need for the support and assistance of the united nations .</seg>
<seg id=1>for many years , the united nations has played a useful role in facilitating the promotion of national reconciliation in postconflict countries , and we believe that the united nations must properly handle the</seg>
<seg id=1>to take into account the relationship between the nearterm needs and the longterm goals .</seg>
<seg id=1>the national reconciliation is generally required to require certain processes , and it is difficult to reach an end .</seg>
<seg id=1>at different stages , it should be different to be different in different stages .</seg>
<seg id=1>to promote national reconciliation , the need for the first combatants to abandon weapons is to create a secure environment .</seg>
<seg id=1>at this stage , efforts are vital to disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of former combatants .</seg>
<seg id=1>we are happy to see that the situation in bosnia and herzegovina is becoming stable and the ethnic relations have further eased , and the economic reconstruction is basically complete and the relations between the UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>the progress made in the peace process in bosnia and herzegovina is nowhere to be satisfied .</seg>
<seg id=1>we wish to express our congratulations to the government and people of bosnia and herzegovina and sincerely hope that the parties in bosnia and herzegovina will continue their efforts to further strengthen mutual trust and cooperation and continuously advance the process of</seg>
<seg id=1>we also note that reform remains to be further improved , especially in the areas of judicial and police affairs .</seg>
<seg id=1>we believe that the high representative will be appropriate to the work of the first half of the year , and we support the government in the work of the high representative .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is believed that , with the help of the international community , the UNK people will strive to achieve new achievements on the path of building their country and at an early date .</seg>
<seg id=1>peace and stability in bosnia and herzegovina are of great significance to the realization of lasting peace and development in the region .</seg>
<seg id=1>the chinese side has always attached great importance to the development of the situation in bosnia and herzegovina , and will continue to work with the international community to help the UNK achieve a lasting peace and economic development .</seg>
<seg id=1>china appreciates the efforts made by the counterterrorism committee to promote the implementation of resolution UNK ( 2001 ) and the efforts to strengthen the capacity building in the developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=1>at the same time , we hope that the counterterrorism committee will work harder to meet the needs of developing countries .</seg>
<seg id=1>at present , the lifting of the antiterrorism commission has attracted the attention of the general membership .</seg>
<seg id=1>after repeated consultations , the counterterrorism committee has submitted formal reports and circulated as the documents of the council .</seg>
<seg id=1>after more than two years of practice , the committee on the counterterrorism committee ( UNK ) has indeed shown that the existing structure and operation methods of the UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>we therefore fully support the need to reform the counterterrorism committee , and we would like to propose the establishment of the antiterrorism commission as soon as possible .</seg>
<seg id=1>here i would like to stress that the revitalization and reform process is an ongoing process , and in any case , the committee on the counterterrorism committee should act in accordance with the UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>in recent years , the issue of salw has been closely watched by the international community .</seg>
<seg id=1>this indicates that the proliferation and illicit trafficking of small arms may be detrimental to the stability of the region and the country and the postwar reconstruction and social development .</seg>
<seg id=1>fortunately , the united nations has taken a series of effective action to address this problem .</seg>
<seg id=1>in 2001 , the firearms protocol and the united nations programme of action were carried out in the united nations convention against transnational organized crime .</seg>
<seg id=1>the legal and policy framework provided for the proper settlement of the issue of salw demonstrated the resolve of the international community to combat the illicit trade of salw .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the past three years , the international community has made great progress in promoting the entry into force of the firearms protocol and implementing the programme of action , especially the successful convening of the united nations UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>resolution UNK , adopted at the current session of the general assembly , decided to establish the working group of the international instruments for the identification and tracing of illicit salw , without a doubt .</seg>
<seg id=1>similarly , the council also attaches great importance to the issue of small arms and has been specifically considered and adopted the statement and resolution .</seg>
<seg id=1>moreover , in considering a range of issues related to the protection of civilians , women and children in the conflict , the council emphasized the importance of addressing the issue of salw .</seg>
<seg id=1>the development of the economy and the eradication of poverty is the basic prerequisite for achieving sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1>the sustainable development of the economy is the material basis of environmental protection and social progress .</seg>
<seg id=1>if we do not solve the problem of survival , we will not be able to advance the development of the issue .</seg>
<seg id=1>to promote economic development and to eradicate poverty is the only way developing the developing countries towards sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1>we will not solve the problem of poverty in developing countries , and the development of the developed countries also goes .</seg>
<seg id=1>the rational utilization of resources and protection of the environment is an inevitable requirement for the achievement of sustainable development .</seg>
<seg id=1>at the expense of resources and at the expense of the environment , development cannot be sustainable .</seg>
<seg id=1>natural resources are inexhaustible inexhaustible , but the demand for social development is constant .</seg>
<seg id=1>only through the path of the most efficient utilization of resources and protecting the environment , sustainable development can be achieved .</seg>
<seg id=1>the final goal of sustainable development is to achieve allround progress and raise people 's living standard and quality .</seg>

<seg id=1>while the international community still faces such problems as the international community is confronted by such problems , the trend of peace and development is irreversible , and the aspirations of the people to the better life have not changed .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is of great significance that the talks should be developed as the theme .</seg>
<seg id=1>the development is the basis for the progress of human civilization and is the key to resolving all the problems facing the world .</seg>
<seg id=1>only through the realization of global coordination , balance and common development , can realize lasting peace and stability of the world .</seg>
<seg id=1>we shall take an indepth and comprehensive approach to this subject and work together to address this issue .</seg>
<seg id=1>the accelerating development of the economic globalization has been the most striking feature of the world economy .</seg>
<seg id=1>driven by the trend of global economic globalization , the links between countries and regions have been strengthened and the market is wider and wider .</seg>
<seg id=1>at the same time , the trend of economic globalization is confronted with severe challenges , and the gap between the north and the south is widening .</seg>

<seg id=1>xinhua news agency , guangzhou , 26 january 2003 from the guangdong provincial chamber of commerce , guangdong 's private enterprises were UNK for the first time .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to statistics , by the end of 2003 , there were UNK enterprises ( including domestic , private and foreign investment enterprises ) , representing an increase of UNK percent over the end of the previous year .</seg>
<seg id=1>in particular , the number of domestic enterprises registered UNK million yuan , or UNK million yuan , and UNK million yuan respectively .</seg>
<seg id=1>the private sector is UNK for the first time over the state and the holding company .</seg>
<seg id=1>the state and the controlling enterprises , although reduced in structural adjustment , increased their strength by UNK million , and 20 percentage points higher than the end of 2002 .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to statistics , in 2003 , the new registered enterprises in the whole province accumulated a total of UNK households .</seg>
<seg id=1>in particular , the number of domestic enterprises was down UNK percent , while that of the private sector was UNK and foreigninvested enterprises .</seg>
<seg id=1>domestic , private and foreign investment corporations account for UNK percent of new registered enterprises .</seg>
<seg id=1>( international ) the wto has already submitted the dispute over the UNK to the arbitration</seg>
<seg id=1>on 26 january , xinhua news agency ( xinhua ) the world trade organization ( xinhua ) announced that the eu and seven other wto members demanded that the complaint be submitted to the united states for the united states .</seg>
<seg id=1>the complaint stemmed from the failure of the united states to repeal the UNK amendment within the context of the wto .</seg>
<seg id=1>the UNK amendment , passed by the us congress in 2000 , required us to pay punitive taxes on antidumping and countervailing duties to the us companies , not to the us treasury .</seg>
<seg id=1>the move comes amid opposition from major trading partners including the european union and japan .</seg>
<seg id=1>the wto ruled that the amendment was enforced by the global trade rules by the end of january 2003 and called on the united states to act by december 27 .</seg>
<seg id=1>but the united states did not carry out the ruling of the wto .</seg>
<seg id=1>to that end , the european union , japan , canada , brazil , india , india , south korea , mexico and chile issued applications to the world trade organization to be allowed to impose additional tariffs equivalent to the u.s.</seg>
<seg id=1>however , the united states then questioned the extent and the legitimacy of the sanctions .</seg>
<seg id=1>( b ) hong kong , hong kong and the hong kong UNK retail business</seg>
<seg id=1>on 28 january , the hong kong retail industry management association ( UNK ) revealed that the lunar new year , the retail sales of hong kong continued to be satisfactory .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to the chairman of the hong kong retail industry management association , the hong kong retail industry has raised hong kong as a whole .</seg>
<seg id=1>he said that mainland chinese tourists use rmb cards in hong kong significantly to stimulate the market at the beginning of the year .</seg>
<seg id=1>in hong kong last year , the retail sales are down 4 per cent .</seg>
<seg id=1>hong kong 's retail sales this year will have a doubledigit growth as the economy recovers , but the cost of goods is rising because of rising costs .</seg>
<seg id=1>he expressed the belief that the hong kong deflation would be improved this year .</seg>
<seg id=1>( international ) a new case against the immigration legislation in denmark</seg>
<seg id=1>the xinhua news agency announced on january 28 that the danish government submitted to the congress a new act against immigrants .</seg>
<seg id=1>under the act , the children born in denmark will no longer enjoy the right to use danish nationality automatically .</seg>
<seg id=1>the act was the latest in a series of restricted immigration measures since november 2001 , the UNK leader .</seg>
<seg id=1>it was reported that the bill was well likely to be adopted by the parliament , because the liberal democratic party had been supported by the right to the right to the immigration issue .</seg>
<seg id=1>the bill requires that children born into denmark should apply for citizenship as well as other migrants , but not to obtain nationality .</seg>
<seg id=1>citizens who have acquired nationality would be deprived of their nationality if they committed criminal crimes against society .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the last two years , the danish government imposed a series of measures to restrict immigration , including limiting the granting of permanent residence and immigration immigration to denmark .</seg>
<seg id=1>thanks to the UNK attitude of the danish government , the number of foreign UNK in denmark reduced from UNK in 1993 to 3,500 in 2003 .</seg>
<seg id=1>the freedom of the freedom and human rights in denmark , as well , has been damaged .</seg>
<seg id=1>less than a month after the spring festival , china has passed three major security incidents , killing dozens of people each time .</seg>
<seg id=1>the occurrence of the occurrence is high , and the loss of life is great .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the past few months , chongqing gas pipelines , the UNK accidents , the gas explosion and frequent UNK accidents have led to the death of hundreds .</seg>
<seg id=1>china is vast and populous , the population is dense , and the probability of suffering is much more than other countries .</seg>
<seg id=1>but , as common sense , the deaths of china are also too frequent .</seg>
<seg id=1>in many disasters , the explosion of fire and coal mines , fireworks factories and passenger traffic accidents .</seg>
<seg id=1>this is at least a reminder of the two problems , one of which is the most vulnerable ; secondly , people do not have to learn from the tragedy of the past , making it UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>in singapore , while the country 's rapid economic growth was past , it was still deep , and it rapidly increased singapore 's awareness of safety in public places .</seg>
<seg id=1>china is currently in a period of rapid economic growth and social transition .</seg>
<seg id=1>although the accident rate is not high , the number of accidents is very low , and the number of accidents is very low .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to the information , 99 persons were executed by accident and death from january 1999 to june 2003 .</seg>
<seg id=1>behind these numbers are the UNK families , such as one and every one , should be able to avoid any unfortunate tragedy .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to the announcement released by the indonesian embassy in recent days , 96 UNK have lost their lives while working in singapore since 1999 .</seg>
<seg id=1>in view of the accident , the indonesian government expressed dissatisfaction and made many efforts to control the quality of the local tax system .</seg>
<seg id=1>what has to be UNK is that the number of numbers on the UNK floor is even higher than the number of people working on construction sites .</seg>
<seg id=1>wang UNK , an expert on taiwan affairs at home and abroad , has recently published the new book .</seg>
<seg id=1>the most part of the book is written by the author until the beginning of the first round of the political party in march 2000 .</seg>
<seg id=1>two years ago , two years later , the article was published two years later .</seg>
<seg id=1>for a long time , UNK has always been seeking truth , seeking truth from facts , and seeking truth from facts and seeking truth from facts .</seg>
<seg id=1>since the beginning of the book , this feature is the most impressive of the impression .</seg>
<seg id=1>since the early 1980s , the study of the taiwan issue has become the explicit learning of the mainland .</seg>
<seg id=1>in overseas , people are generally divided into the north and the south .</seg>
<seg id=1>the position of the north is close to the official , and in certain certain historical stages or major political developments , there are more UNK bands .</seg>
<seg id=1>the UNK , the UNK , distributed in the south of the yangtze , including shanghai and fujian .</seg>
<seg id=1>the japanese media have been exposed to the japanese media in the japanese media .</seg>
<seg id=1>the japanese newspaper weekly showed to the university of london , mr koizumi , that koizumi had not received any degrees in the UNK class .</seg>
<seg id=1>the scandal won the UNK of the state 's size media to report or remove it .</seg>
<seg id=1>indeed , the prime minister of the republic of china , as the prime minister , UNK his UNK to deceive the national people .</seg>
<seg id=1>in particular , japan , especially for the japanese , was especially vulnerable to the japanese occupation .</seg>
<seg id=1>but , if we can change to one point , there might be some positive points in this scandal .</seg>
<seg id=1>and these positive things are just what we need to improve .</seg>
<seg id=1>we have been promoting honesty and integrity in recent years to create the sunshine government , to respect the public , and to increase the transparency of the public .</seg>
<seg id=1>you think , the diploma of the national prime minister was not too big , but could be revealed by the media and UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>so far as the state is concerned , what is the case with the sun ?</seg>
<seg id=1>the taiwan election UNK . the main camps will be able to use the UNK to send the mass to the mass , but the current situation is that there are many significant differences in the UNK party .</seg>
<seg id=1>not long ago , when taiwan president chen shuibian landed in a certain place in the north , there were half of the people who had UNK to the local people .</seg>
<seg id=1>if there is no accident , the election of taiwan 's presidential election to the UNK , and so on , should be supposed to be UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>if the more aggressive plot , such as the UNK , or the UNK scandal , it would be proved that lee tenghui would be able to win the great hall .</seg>
<seg id=1>facing the possibility of UNK the UNK power , beijing should look at it</seg>
<seg id=1>first , it should be understood that the UNK UNK may not be the single party , the UNK , and the domestic tradition .</seg>
<seg id=1>the close cooperation between the current election period cannot be regarded as the future .</seg>
<seg id=1>if the elections were to be seen , it would have to be considerable time to combine consolidation , and by the end of the year , the courts would have made it hard to make significant changes .</seg>
<seg id=1>unless it is aware that the improvement of crossstrait relations can be divided into political UNK in taiwan and that confidence can be done within a short time , the most important thing is to UNK the chinese</seg>
<seg id=1>in the light of this background , beijing should suspend the movement of UNK to the time that the leader of the traditional UNK is consolidated .</seg>
<seg id=1>it has been over half a century since the first nuclear explosion in the united states in july 1945 .</seg>
<seg id=1>fortunately the arms race between the united states and the united states , the arms race of the united states and the united states , made it possible for the arms race to reach the world .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the wake of the collapse of the soviet union and the postcoldwar era , the risk of largescale nuclear war eliminated .</seg>
<seg id=1>but at the same time , the risk of nuclear proliferation is not less , but it increases .</seg>
<seg id=1>the phenomena of the diffusion are shown in two respects : the phenomena of this proliferation are two aspects .</seg>
<seg id=1>first , countries with considerable resources and a level of strength have been striving for the production and possession of nuclear weapons through various means .</seg>
<seg id=1>another group of nonstate organizations , especially the muslim extremists in the west , sought to search for small nuclear weapons .</seg>
<seg id=1>at the same time , the UNK between the transfer of nuclear weapons and related technology transfer and purchase and sale , as well as the large scale of nuclear weapons , have become an important part of the current nuclear proliferation .</seg>
<seg id=1>the appearance of the countryside and the rural life of the farmers is still in my memory .</seg>
<seg id=1>at the end of the year , people returned to their homes and found that there were three floors of the UNK buildings along the UNK expressway .</seg>
<seg id=1>i was surprised to believe that , in the UNK , i could hardly believe that i would take such a change .</seg>
<seg id=1>however , the recent survey by scholars from the internet on the internet was UNK and UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>the chinese farmers still have the same humiliation and the difficult and difficult life of the country .</seg>
<seg id=1>the UNK , in the rural field survey of anhui , henan and hebei province , was UNK by the chinese rural area .</seg>
<seg id=1>when we come to china , we feel that we have never seen the death of the young man .</seg>
<seg id=1>this is indeed an answer to the blood of the heart of the UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>prime minister abdullah UNK , prime minister of malaysia , announced the dissolution of the congress on the day before .</seg>
<seg id=1>for UNK , the election would be a significant event in its political life , and that the result of the elections was equally symbolic for the malaysian council and its development trend .</seg>
<seg id=1>UNK took the reins of leadership from UNK in november , and only four months .</seg>
<seg id=1>however , he decided to dissolve the congress , and to get ahead of the elections .</seg>
<seg id=1>that at least contains two meanings : one , who is satisfied with the achievements of his four months , and he hopes to consolidate his power base so that he may be UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>there is no doubt that the decision of the UNK de UNK elections reflects the comprehensive assessment of his country 's political situation .</seg>
<seg id=1>the present economic situation of the UNK is well above and there are still no issues that could be brought about by the opposition .</seg>
<seg id=1>more , however , the UNK has taken some high visibility measures , including the UNK , the former land and cooperative development minister , and the minister for development of the land and cooperatives .</seg>
<seg id=1>at the same time , he appealed to the greater efficiency of civil service , which was also encouraging the sentiment of the people .</seg>
<seg id=1>since the birth date , the development of the european union has been affected by the strong influence of french politics and culture .</seg>
<seg id=1>diplomatic efforts to achieve independence and independence should be different from the united states . this is the direction of eu foreign policy .</seg>
<seg id=1>so , including china , russia and the arab countries , the international community wants to see the rise of the european union and hope to see an entirely independent force .</seg>
<seg id=1>it must be acknowledged that , since the end of the 1980s , the european union has been working towards that direction .</seg>
<seg id=1>in december 1992 , the heads of the european union agreed to agree on the UNK summit , which all member states would implement the unified foreign policy to speak with the same calibre .</seg>
<seg id=1>but two years later , when handling the question of bosnia , the socalled united nations diplomatic policy was first UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>from the UNK until today , eu foreign affairs can be said to be UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>in particular , the foreign policy of the european union is totally free of the test of events .</seg>
<seg id=1>the various positions of the member states against the war in iraq have not proved to be that , and they have again been fully exposed to the european union 's political UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>on february 24 , president bush announced the white house that he would support the constitution of the UNK marriage .</seg>
<seg id=1>this is the obvious change in his attitude to the problem , representing the important development of the american election year .</seg>
<seg id=1>this is a very powerful political weapon in the southern part of the united states .</seg>
<seg id=1>after the election of the year 2000 , it was obvious that he was the UNK and not the bush himself .</seg>
<seg id=1>in addition , the united states has been growing ever more open on the UNK issue , and that the act of mr bush , although shortterm results , would hurt the longterm interests of the republican .</seg>
<seg id=1>the new bush , the new bush , is the UNK strategy for the election of this year .</seg>
<seg id=1>the strategy is because he is increasingly vulnerable to the two important issues in the war on terror and economy .</seg>
<seg id=1>the attitude of the united states to date is still cautious .</seg>
<seg id=1>that is why the united states should avoid political and military conflict with china , because the current situation in the taiwan could meet the longterm goals of the united states in the strategic position of the united states .</seg>
<seg id=1>it would be possible to imagine that the united states would not be fully in keeping with the requirements of beijing , and the removal of the space of the referendum would be completely eliminated .</seg>
<seg id=1>the united states secretary of state powell has recently reaffirmed that the united states is in the position to oppose taiwan independence .</seg>
<seg id=1>the statement was interpreted as an attempt to contain and prevent chen UNK , the former president .</seg>
<seg id=1>the united states is very concerned about the situation in the taiwan strait because of the recent remarks by a number of people with the official background , and the united states will send a large number of spy ships to the strait .</seg>
<seg id=1>it has shown another point of view that , while the united states does not , in accordance with the requirements of beijing , be obliged to stop the referendum , the uncertainty about the situation in the taiwan straits is also</seg>
<seg id=1>any large scale and one pair of elections could lead to the end of one result , or that mr. chen was reelected , or UNK to the taiwan palace .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is worrying that , in the absence of information , people in the mainland appear to have not prepared themselves to be able to win .</seg>
<seg id=1>if the result of the elections is not desirable , it will again make beijing UNK into an unnecessary passive position .</seg>
<seg id=1>the UNK of the day was more horrible than the year of the millennium .</seg>
<seg id=1>but what is the fear of the african countries today ?</seg>
<seg id=1>i think the answer is certain . i think the answer is certainly positive .</seg>
<seg id=1>one of the most recent studies and development centres close to washington , the u.s. government , has explored four options for the dprk nuclear crisis , namely , communication , UNK , economic sanctions and UNK attacks .</seg>
<seg id=1>the attitude of the regional countries towards these policies is the focus of the survey .</seg>
<seg id=1>in addition , the investigation also deals with the threat posed by the north korean nuclear weapons program , as well as possible damage and their fears .</seg>
<seg id=1>china and russia see the dangers of north korea 's use nuclear weapons low or very low , while the japanese and south koreans believe it is threatening .</seg>
<seg id=1>all the northeast asian countries agreed with north korea to keep contacts with the dprk .</seg>
<seg id=1>while japan supported the UNK , other countries believed that , in certain cases , the UNK strategy would be acceptable .</seg>
<seg id=1>singapore is very much concerned about the international ranking , and one year it is very important to the american and american institutions .</seg>
<seg id=1>at the top of the table , nature also increases our interest in the ranking .</seg>
<seg id=1>but the first trouble is that there is no need to worry about .</seg>
<seg id=1>generally , it appears to be too proud to pay too much attention to the ranking .</seg>
<seg id=1>so people said that we ought to live more and more easily , and the best would be best .</seg>
<seg id=1>because many of us do not seem to be able to be UNK in the past , it appears that people do not appear to be the first to be good news .</seg>
<seg id=1>however , the situation has been reversed over the past two years , however .</seg>
<seg id=1>we are skeptical about the country 's longterm competitiveness , and the people of all walks of life fear their success .</seg>
<seg id=1>there is such doubts that we should not be so smart in words .</seg>
<seg id=1>the international competition is fierce , and the UNK can lead to other people , and the first is prone to become backward .</seg>
<seg id=1>on the face of the republican governors meeting , mr. bush secured assurances that mr. cheney was vicepresident of the state .</seg>
<seg id=1>but he said it would be like that in 2000 he had been appointed as a candidate for his identification .</seg>
<seg id=1>UNK UNK , who has been UNK to UNK , recently repeated the media interviews and denied that it would be replaced .</seg>
<seg id=1>but he left the steps . but he left the stage .</seg>
<seg id=1>he said that if the health problem was serious , and if the president was UNK , he would be UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>he was 63 years old and had four heart disease records .</seg>
<seg id=1>recently , the united states of america has been in fact to UNK the ninth one .</seg>
<seg id=1>the presidential elections were voted on november 2 and the pentagon was said to have arranged for UNK UNK in october .</seg>
<seg id=1>but , by the end of the year , the UNK , however , became UNK , and began to be UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>it appears that mr. UNK is a UNK to mr. bush 's vote for the insurance .</seg>
<seg id=1>the winner of the 2004 presidential election was confirmed by the democratic candidate john kerry and the challenge republican president george w . bush .</seg>
<seg id=1>they began to engage in activities such as ads campaign and campaign campaign before the november election .</seg>
<seg id=1>they are going to collide with the three major topics in the war , economy and society .</seg>
<seg id=1>he believed that the war was closely related to the security of the united states ; saddam hussein was trying to ensure the security of the united states .</seg>
<seg id=1>the nature will suggest that the mistake of the bush abuse of toxic weapons is not the war in iraq .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the economy , mr kerry believes mr bush 's tax cuts are good for the wealthy to make new jobs .</seg>
<seg id=1>mr bush said that the current us economic figure was not a positive one .</seg>
<seg id=1>social problems , in relation to the relationship between men and women , bush opposes marriage , against abortion , and favour abortion .</seg>
<seg id=1>mr. bush and obama expressed their views on the three big issues , using ads , television , speeches and convincing voters that they both have to perform in the last eight months .</seg>
<seg id=1>but on the diplomatic front , there was a greater amount of space for the space .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to the information , young people aged 15 to 19 years older than adolescents aged 15 to 19 .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is generally believed that the academic pressure is the cause of the suicide of children and adolescents , but the study found that emotional problems , especially the problems between men and women , and the problems associated with the UNK</seg>
<seg id=1>the UNK of the pressure and the expectations of the present also belong to the part of the communication between parents and the child .</seg>
<seg id=1>the stress is that local school is a permanent burden , and when the stress is given itself , it is often made up of parents .</seg>
<seg id=1>parents ask the child to be good enough , and they will not be able to take up other children to require the child to be UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>if the child is not UNK , the parents will be disappointed , or even to be bad .</seg>
<seg id=1>young people , who are known to be able to receive counselling , are UNK by high expectations of their parents .</seg>
<seg id=1>singapore 's success and rapid growth allows parents to think that the current material conditions of their children are much better than themselves , and that the child is certainly better than himself .</seg>
<seg id=1>generally , when the parent forget that it is still the child , the performance of the various sides may not be exceptional .</seg>
<seg id=1>by the end of the year , the overwhelming majority of children were being sent to the camps for the UNK , and the authorities were only UNK to take a few dollars .</seg>
<seg id=1>today , singapore is facing a decline in birth rate and social problems of ageing populations .</seg>
<seg id=1>the younger generation , for the sake of the modern living standards and the fashion of fashion , will be able to respond to the government 's early years early .</seg>
<seg id=1>the author has a bold suggestion that the government should be elected by the government to receive the newborn children .</seg>
<seg id=1>there is no need to worry about the nurturing of the chinese people .</seg>
<seg id=1>on the one hand , the government has launched the UNK kindergarten , and the primary change is to be divided into fulltime , or even providing services to the public .</seg>
<seg id=1>this would not only solve the employment problem of the unemployed , but the government did not need to provide for the success of the measures such as UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>beijing needs to be done not only to be the leader of the sixparty talks , but also to china 's longterm interest in the korean peninsula , and for the early strategic deployment .</seg>
<seg id=1>in particular , on the one hand , it is necessary to push forward north korea to abandon the nuclear weapons , and to lift it to the road of modern civilization , to remove the danger of war ii</seg>
<seg id=1>pyongyang UNK its own eagerness to develop the economy and integrate into the international community .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is only that this desire is often manifested in the external forms of international rules by virtue of the UNK , UNK , and sometimes .</seg>
<seg id=1>indeed , for some time , beijing has taken advantage of leverage and UNK to force pyongyang to change its position .</seg>
<seg id=1>but the action is still going to be full planning .</seg>
<seg id=1>beijing 's aid to pyongyang should not be confined to the rest of the economy , expanding to other areas of society ; not limited to pyongyang to abandon its nuclear program .</seg>
<seg id=1>there was no hope of him at the beginning of the UNK , when all the focus was focused on the former governor UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>but before the meeting held in january , mr. UNK raised the most key group of the UNK and the new hampshire party and the new hampshire .</seg>
<seg id=1>at the beginning of the next division , there was not enough UNK , because the state had its own candidates .</seg>
<seg id=1>he spent only six weeks , and his competitors , including UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK , had made the political charm .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the 19 years of the senator , kerry has been supporting abortion and environmental policies , UNK the tax cuts that would benefit the wealthy and strive to improve the minimum wage , hoping to address global warming .</seg>
<seg id=1>his experience in washington shows that he is willing to confront the social problems , dare to challenge the authority , and to pursue values and fears .</seg>
<seg id=1>the policy of reform and opening to china began in the beginning of the year .</seg>
<seg id=1>after the 1990s , however , the agricultural reform was basically UNK and the gap between urban and rural areas was becoming increasingly constant .</seg>
<seg id=1>china , UNK , presented two distinct worlds , one of the most prosperous , and the poverty and rural villages .</seg>
<seg id=1>in china 's official statement , the expansion of the gap between the poor and the poor is the issue of development , so it is to be settled through continued development .</seg>
<seg id=1>that is to say , the coastal regions and cities of china should continue to develop and that they should not be UNK by the rural problems .</seg>
<seg id=1>but when viewing some of the large parts of the year , and three in three years , why not have any change in some poor areas have changed in the last few years</seg>
<seg id=1>of course , there is a very different approach to the development of urban and rural areas , which should be acknowledged by encouraging and supporting the rural population of 70 per cent of the country 's population .</seg>
<seg id=1>on the theory , the problems of agriculture , rural and rural areas have not been paid attention to .</seg>
<seg id=1>however , the growing difficulties and deterioration of the countryside in these years have demonstrated the growing degree of its importance .</seg>
<seg id=1>in any country , the law of justice , examination and law should be the symbol of justice and equity , and also be the most important institution of social stability .</seg>
<seg id=1>unfortunately , it is the symbol of corruption in china , and the law and the law and the law .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to the national audit office , the results of last year 's financial expenditure of the ministry of public security in 26 provinces reached UNK billion yuan .</seg>
<seg id=1>the crisis of faith in the public , the law and the law has been UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>the UNK incident , the UNK incident and the recent heilongjiang UNK incident all reflect the profound mistrust .</seg>
<seg id=1>the bmw event is much more typical of the bmw event .</seg>
<seg id=1>the concern is far more focused on the problem than in the sars period .</seg>
<seg id=1>in fact , the attention was not bmw events itself , but expressed their distrust of the entire system of justice .</seg>
<seg id=1>the relevant departments are very clear that they will soon have taken the initiative to take measures .</seg>
<seg id=1>the problem was , however , that the problem was still there .</seg>
<seg id=1>the second round of sixparty talks on the korean peninsula nuclear issue ended in the common expectations .</seg>
<seg id=1>during this meeting , the concerned parties reached agreement on the issues of the peninsula crisis and reached consensus on the third round of talks and the setting up of the working group by the end of the june .</seg>
<seg id=1>but how the north should give up to the political and military security of the north and provide energy aid to north korea ?</seg>
<seg id=1>both of the two protagonists have failed to yield concessions , and the basic positions of both parties have not been compromised .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is clear , however , that the united states shows an attitude that is not eager to resolve the problem during this round of talks .</seg>
<seg id=1>these strategies in the united states are closely related to the new development of the current international situation and the interests of these new developments .</seg>
<seg id=1>since roosevelt was elected president , the united states has never been UNK by so many bosses .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is coincidence , and the public and the investors , who have been exposed to the crime of corporate crime and other illegal practices in three years .</seg>
<seg id=1>the answer may not be easy , but recent criminal activities have been revealed by the fact .</seg>
<seg id=1>this is a good omen for the economic recovery , especially to revive investment .</seg>
<seg id=1>the end of the 1990s was probably one of the most UNK and UNK stage of american business history .</seg>
<seg id=1>the names of some companies will be UNK , and eventually they can be found only on the textbook of the business school .</seg>
<seg id=1>others , such as UNK and UNK , will be struggling to restructure to meet the new round of economic growth .</seg>
<seg id=1>when the new round of economic growth is concerned</seg>
<seg id=1>as chief of the ceo you might not have an answer .</seg>
<seg id=1>that 's all right , because the fed chairman alan greenspan did not know .</seg>
<seg id=1>the bush administration wants to use keynes to spur the economy to increase spending , in particular defence spending , on substantial tax cuts .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the international arena , the bush administration has continued to pursue free trade , but the trade deficit has reached UNK bn .</seg>
<seg id=1>but there is no significant growth in investment and consumption after major tax cuts .</seg>
<seg id=1>according to the UNK school of UNK , the famous english economist , the us economy is now in distress , and the bush financial strategy UNK .</seg>
<seg id=1>they believed that the socalled UNK of market law was only an illusion that would inevitably lead to the UNK of the majority .</seg>
<seg id=1>in the united states , most people in the united states are in the united states .</seg>
<seg id=1>but it is not so that the truth is that it is not true .</seg>
<seg id=1>many people in the united states believe that the winners of the current globalisation , apart from the us base on america , are also in a strong position .</seg>
<seg id=1>the ministry of occupation of india is in the field of the occupation of the economy .</seg>
<seg id=1>attention was focused on the huge influx of u.s. dollars to china , but not in china 's high , lowincome labour market .</seg>
<seg id=1>at the end of the day , taiwan UNK is estimated to be in the estimation of beijing .</seg>
<seg id=1>there is only to be seen in beijing , but it is estimated that others will be able to look at the public .</seg>
<seg id=1>during the last four years , mr. chen shuibian , the lu UNK faction and the chinese side have made great efforts in the area of independence .</seg>
<seg id=1>in contrast , in addition to having a UNK tone , beijing appears to be in close proximity to the routine .</seg>
<seg id=1>but since the fall of the year , it has become quite different from the fall , as if it were UNK , it was obvious to the 1990s .</seg>
<seg id=1>this can be seen in the estimation of the agreement by the state council .</seg>
<seg id=1>second , there is diplomatic ties to taiwan .</seg>
<seg id=1>with regard to the situation in the taiwan straits , the attitude of the united states is close to beijing and is close to taipei .</seg>
<seg id=1>it is clear that the answer is clear because the states are publicly visible .</seg>
<seg id=1>to date , the state and beijing will not just be closer to each other , and there will be more specific UNK and more UNK .</seg>
