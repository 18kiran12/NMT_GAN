<EOS1> entering the new century , economic globalization becomes a major and grim challenge facing african countries . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> african leaders are increasingly recognizing that africa can no longer stand up and that it should rise up . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on july 9 , 2002 , the african union formally established and started operation , and since that time , african countries have actively pursued the new partnership for africa 's development . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the urgency of ending the armed conflict has been heightened by the prevailing situation in africa , which has been UNK and marked by a marked slowdown in hot issues . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> with the strong support of the united nations and the international community , regional organizations , regional countries and prominent statesmen in africa , as well as prominent politicians , have been active in action to increase regional conflict and the elimination of internal and UNK conflict and instability 
<EOS1> for example , in june of last year the government of the democratic republic of the congo signed a peace agreement between the government of UNK and the government of south africa in october . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> of course , the stability situation in the african region is still relatively fragile , and the peace gains need to be consolidated and some potential or real armed conflicts still remain pending . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the same time , the economic development of african countries continues to be significant in the same way as developing countries in asia , which are a negative factor in africa 's development . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> how can african countries effectively meet the challenge of economic globalization to achieve africa 's recovery and the long - standing and arduous struggle of the african people . <EOS2>

<EOS1> taiwan and japan , as democratic nations , have the duty and responsibility to work together to consolidate democracy in asia . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in order to promote democratic values , the government has established the foundation for taiwan 's democracy in the near future , which is one of the priorities of its work . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the democratic people 's republic of china hopes to join hands with all the political parties of the country , share with other countries the experience of democratic development and contribute to peace , stability and prosperity in asia and realize the ideal of the alliance for democracy in 
<EOS1> in a volatile international situation today , the regional powers hand in hand , the whole body , the security of all states are tested. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> for the asia - pacific region , since the u . s . war against iraq last month , china 's nuclear - powered north korea has UNK missiles , flying over japan 's airspace over the sea and deploying its ballistic missiles to taiwan . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> all this is a serious threat to the security of the two countries and the asiapacific region . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> those issues relating to the consolidation and security of democracy require the formal security mechanism to be addressed and resolved. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> today 's meeting is a democracy for the ruling party of taiwan , and with the japanese ruling liberal democrats and other political parties for the first time in a formal dialogue on security issues . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i am also looking forward to the establishment of the " security dialogue mechanism " , in addition to the bilateral dialogues between china , japan and japan . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> today is an important moment to encourage us to continue the path of reform , and we will give the greatest affirmation to all our party comrades to demonstrate our will and work together to achieve the reform objectives . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> " political party withdrawal from the media " is the most basic requirement of the reform of the media , it is also the concept that the democratic people 's republic of china consistently adheres to . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we also know that to promote this objective , the party 's political comrades take the first step out of the media , the media reform is a small step , but also a key step . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> during the period of the media monopoly over the period of the past , many comrades in the party have devoted considerable effort to the task of opening up the fourth , local radio station and so on . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> for example , comrade liu UNK was the birth of the fourth wireless tv station , devoting a lot of effort to the birth of the first wireless tv station . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this will have a considerable impact on the whole media environment , especially in breaking three long - standing monopoly situations and increasing the space for more cable television . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but we must understand that , because of the limitations of the historic environment , there is a lot of UNK in the process of promoting reform , so that the media space is already open to today , and that the reform process will continue to move forward 
<EOS1> UNK declares that all party members of the party , UNK UNK , the day before the session , that is , the first nine days before the full withdrawal from the operation of the press , by example to lead by example to achieve the commitment of the 
<EOS1> we are very pleased with the party 's ideals and objectives , including UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK in the democratic movement . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> not power is the enjoyment of power , but the aggravation of responsibility . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> democracy in the process of governance , or setbacks and turbulence , we can always be able to challenge the momentum of moving forward , steady lead taiwan 's construction of taiwan to deepen the construction of the project , and the universal values of democracy , peace and 
<EOS1> because we have always believed that the people are the masters of this country , the democratic progressive party 's responsibility is to raise the spirit of the UNK spirit of UNK , UNK , and love . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> for a long time , democracy has played a role in the effort to expand diplomatic relations in taiwan , creating brilliant achievements . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> despite the constant pressure of the chinese communist party , we never retreat , because the fate of our own hands in our own hands , even if we do not have the resources of the resources , the democratic UNK still step one step , the expansion of 
<EOS1> in the past year , we have shared with regional countries the economic challenges posed by the east asian region , the democratic reform of the party , the political , the resolution of globalization and poverty . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in march of next year , i will also formally take over the chairman of the " liberal democracy coalition in asia " who , in their capacity as leaders of international organizations , will offer opportunities to create more international contributions to taiwan . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in addition , the democratic people 's republic of china was actively involved in the relevant conferences following the official membership of the international league for freedom last year . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in addition to the human rights commissioner 's secretariat at london 's headquarters , a seminar on political reform in central and south america was conducted in cooperation with other member political parties . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in UNK , the party adopted the 17 th birthday party of the party . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the 17 - year - old democracy of democracy , along the way to adhere to the ideal of democracy , full reform progress of the force . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> because we have always been on the side of democratic reform , we can gain the trust of the people of taiwan , because of this , the future of our responsibility and responsibility will be more serious and serious . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> three years ago when we received the burden of power , the ruling party was UNK through six times in the 1990 s . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in 1991 , the congress of the people 's congress of china , the provincial government of 1997 , the provincial government of 1997 , the provincial government in 1997 and the national congress in 2000 were very UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> if we act as the most important symbol of a democratically elected , democratically elected democratic state in 1996 , the " complete " country is full of ten years in 2006 . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> after ten years of practice , we must think , as a sovereign and independent state , what we are going to pursue in the next step . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i must say that the next stage we should pursue further in the pursuit of democracy and a more efficient constitutional system , we can take the people of taiwan to accept the serious challenge of the new century . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> asia , the largest continent in the world , accounts for almost 30 per cent of the global land surface , which currently accounts for 60 per cent of the world 's population and a quarter of the world total. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> asia has a long and brilliant culture , the yellow river and the yangtze river valley , the UNK river and the UNK river valley , the euphrates river and the UNK river valley is the famous human civilization birthplace . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the long course of history , the people of asia wrote a glorious chapter in the development of human civilization . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> since the beginning of modern times , asia has been suffering a lot , and the people of all countries have made unremitting efforts to liberate , seek development and make unremitting efforts . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but there is a long way to go before we can achieve the new rising and revitalization of asia . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> strengthening cooperation , promoting development and achieving a winwin situation is the only way for asia 's rise and rejuvenation as well as the fundamental interests of the asian people . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> under the new situation of the new century , the asian development faces new opportunities . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> peace and development remain the themes of our times , the international environment of general peace , providing favourable external conditions for the development of asia . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the rapid development of the economic globalization , the rapid progress of the world technological revolution , the optimization of the international production factor and the acceleration of the industrial transfer and development of the international capital , the introduction of advanced technology and the development of international markets 
<EOS1> rich in asia , the market is vast and is the most economically dynamic region in the world today . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> man , underdevelopment , this is china 's two national conditions . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> china has 1.3 billion people , no matter how small , as long as 1.3 billion , it is a very big problem , no matter how substantial financial , material and material resources , as long as the 1.3 billion , that will be very low level of 
<EOS1> this is what chinese leaders must always remember . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> to solve the problems of 1.3 billion people , can not rely on others , only rely on themselves . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> since the founding of the people 's republic of china , great achievements have been made in our construction and at the same time , we have taken some UNK and lost opportunities . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> since 1978 reform and opening up , we have finally found a way to develop themselves . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this is the independence of the chinese people to build socialism with chinese characteristics . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the essence of this road is to mobilize all positive factors , to liberate and develop the productive forces , to respect and guarantee the freedom of the chinese people to pursue happiness . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> china 's reform and opening up , from rural to urban , from the economic field to political , cultural and social fields . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> its every step , in the final analysis , is aimed at giving up all the labour , knowledge , technology , management and the dynamism of all the resources that create wealth . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in recent years , the world is undergoing profound changes , scientific and technological progress , the world productivity level constantly increasing , the connection of the world market more closely , creating a historic opportunity for countries to create a historic opportunity . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , it is noteworthy that the problems of conflict , regional conflict , terrorism , infectious diseases and environmental degradation are still threatening the stability and development of the world . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the negative effects of economic globalization have increased the risks and costs of the economic and social development of developing countries , and some developing countries are even at risk of being marginalized. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> today , despite the gradual recovery of the world economy , there are still many uncertainties . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the doha round of multilateral trade negotiations suffered setbacks , and the complex factors of trade protectionism increased difficulties in developing countries . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it is gratifying to note that the developing countries have been actively committed to reform , reform and development and have achieved remarkable achievements . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on the international stage , the developing countries strengthened solidarity and cooperation on the basis of the non - aligned movement and the group of 77 , and made important contributions to the maintenance of their legitimate rights and interests and the changing of the international political and economic 
<EOS1> at the same time , the exchanges and cooperation between developing countries have yielded fruitful results , as well as more frequent economic exchanges . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> from the andes to the mekong river , from the maghreb union to the establishment of the african union , south - south cooperation , from the content to the form , has been enriched , refined and updated. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the past year has been a year of complete development of the friendly and cooperative relations between china and canada . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the two countries ' trade maintained the momentum of growth , which was close to $ 10 billion . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the supreme court of the supreme court of china , the minister of commerce , the president of the supreme court of china , the minister of foreign affairs and the secretary of defense and the minister of foreign affairs visited china successively . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> recently , premier wen jiabao 's visit to canada was beginning to fall short , and the significance of his visit to canada was a new impetus for further development of bilateral relations . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> china and canada will continue to strengthen cooperation in the political , economic , cultural and educational fields , and strive to achieve the goal of doubling the total volume of bilateral trade by 2010 . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> ladies and gentlemen , dear friends . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> although you live overseas , we have always been concerned about the development of our country , and at every crucial moment , we always worry about the motherland and the people of our motherland . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> last year , after sars and flooding in some parts of china , you expressed deep concern and blessing to the chinese people through various channels such as internet , letters , telephone calls and donations . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> during the visit of premier wen jiabao , hundreds of UNK and foreign students took the courage of the premier wen jiabao and the foreign students to welcome the visit of premier wen jiabao . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in this regard , i would like to take this opportunity to express our sincere gratitude to all of you for your continued commitment to the new year of china and canada in the new year . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> first , strengthen political trust and deepen strategic cooperation . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the two countries , both permanent members of the united nations security council , are countries that have a significant influence on international affairs . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we both agree to promote the UNK of the world , to uphold the authority of the united nations and to promote a new international political and economic order that conforms to the wishes of peoples . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we share a broad range of common understandings and common interests in addressing the challenges and the proper handling of the human face . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we are ready to strengthen dialogue and consultation on major issues of combating terrorism , non - proliferation , combating transnational crime and promoting common development and strengthening the role of the united nations . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> second , we will strengthen economic and trade cooperation and achieve mutually beneficial complementarity . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> china is the largest developing country in the world , and is working on its modernization drive with a wide market . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> france is the world leader in the economic and technological level , with leading technology in many fields . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the economic and trade cooperation between our two countries is very strong , and the economic and trade cooperation is enormous . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> since the founding of new china , the chinese government has attached great importance to the development of non - relations and formulated a series of policies and policies . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we have consistently adhered to the five principles of peaceful coexistence and respected africa 's independent and autonomous choice of political systems and the development of the road network to provide assistance to african countries in providing assistance to african countries in support of african countries . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the friendship between china and africa is profound and popular . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> since the founding of new china , we have been firmly committed to the cause of national liberation in africa and sincerely assist african countries in developing their national economy . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> chinese experts , doctors , teachers and workers sent to africa work side by side with the local people , get along and get along . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in international affairs , china and african countries understand each other and support each other . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the chinese people will never forget that , at the sixty - first session of the general assembly in 1971 , china successfully restored the rightful seat in the united nations with the great support of the vast developing countries , including those in africa . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in recent years , china 's various levels of political trust have been deepening , fruitful cooperation in the field of economic cooperation and trade , education , health , science and technology , and sports in the fields of science and technology . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the two sides identified the establishment of a new type of partnership with long - term stability and mutual benefit , and the new phase of the development of friendly and friendly cooperation between china and africa . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> seven years after nixon 's visit to china and the shanghai communiqu é , the government of UNK accepted china 's position on the taiwan issue and realized diplomatic relations . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this incident and deng xiaoping 's successful visit to the united states opened a new chapter in chinaus relations . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> during the early days of president reagan , the united states had a bitter encounter with taiwan . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> after arduous negotiations , the governments of the two countries issued the famous UNK UNK communiqu é in 1982 , which reached agreement on step - by - step solutions . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the communiqu é of the communiqu é of the shanghai communiqu é and the communiqu é s of the communiqu é of the united states of america and the united states of america constitute the political cornerstone of the sino - us relations . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> during the decade of diplomatic relations , despite the struggles of the two countries on issues such as taiwan , chinaus relations are generally stable , with increasing contacts and cooperation in all its aspects . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the 1980 s , the early 1990 s , the UNK of eastern europe , the collapse of the soviet union and the end of the cold war , the international situation had changed since the second world war . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the united states led the u . s . sanctions against china , declaring that 150 f - 16 s , linking human rights issues and most - favoured - nation treatment to the u . s . , led to a decline in sinous relations . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> with the rapid development of china 's economy , china 's international status is constantly improving . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> more and more people in the united states have recognized that the improvement and development of chinaus relations are in the interests of both china and the united states . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> six months ago , in this hall , we successfully initiated the process of the sixparty talks , establishing the direction of a peaceful resolution of the nuclear issue . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> over the past six months , there is a continuing dialogue and consultations among the parties to prepare for the new round of talks and to prepare for the new round of talks and to enhance mutual understanding of each other 's positions . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> now , the various parties look forward to discussing the substance of the second round of talks and achieving a concrete result of the concerted and coordinated steps of the sixparty talks . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> these constitute the essential foundation of our talks today . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the importance of the second round of talks is to initiate discussions on substantive issues , marking a new step forward in the peace talks process . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the current round of talks will involve the establishment of specific objectives for the resolution of the nuclear issue and to explore the first phase of the nuclear issue , examining the way in which the continued process of the talks continues . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> with the deepening of the talks , we will meet more challenges and meet more challenges , but that is the responsibility that has given us history and the international community . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we are gathered here on behalf of the six governments and people to seek a strong political aspiration for peace . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> our talks are aimed at widening the consensus rather than sharpening the divides , in order to resolve the problem rather than sharpening the conflict . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> china believes that the parties can be aware of the mission of peace and the spirit of cooperation and understanding in a constructive and cooperative manner , demonstrating flexibility and narrowing the gaps . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the second round of the beijing sixparty talks , over three days consultation , completed the scheduled agenda . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i would like to express my gratitude to the governments and their leaders and representatives , and to the staff of the country for their contributions . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> if it is said that the first round of talks set the goal of denuclearization of the peninsula , the significance of the current round of talks is a substantive dialogue and a new step towards achieving the big goal. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> during the talks , the parties conducted indepth and constructive discussions on ways and means to solve the problem through wisdom and rationality . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the talks reached a series of useful results , particularly in reaching consensus on the round of talks and the establishment of working groups , which were important for advancing the peace process . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> dear colleagues , peace and development are the themes of our great times . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the people of the six nations represented here need peace , peace , love for peace , peace , peace and peace . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> over the past three days , the international community has looked at beijing , watching the summit and looking forward to this round of talks . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> perhaps some people think the result of the talks is not enough , the process is not fast enough . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> my view is that the current round of talks is being launched without a sense of mutual trust and a widening gap between our positions . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the chinese government 's position on taiwan is consistent , i . e . adhering to the basic principles of peaceful reunification , one country , two systems and one country . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> to this end , we have made every effort to show the greatest sincerity and do much work . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , our efforts are being challenged by the taiwan authorities and the UNK forces of taiwan independence . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we respect the democratic requirements of the people of taiwan , but we are opposed to the motion of taiwan independence from the taiwan authorities and the UNK forces of taiwan independence . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we have made it clear that the determination and will of our country to maintain the unity of our country is the peace and stability of the taiwan straits region . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we have said that as long as there is hope , we will do our best to achieve the unity of our country in a peaceful way . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we appreciate president bush 's renewed UNK of china 's position and send a clear signal to the UNK forces of taiwan independence . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the leaders of the taiwan authorities claimed that the state of UNK was committed to the prevention of china 's invasion of taiwan by force . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this is a UNK of the peace efforts of the mainland , as well as the provocation of cross - straits relations . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at present , the reality of security in taiwan is not from the mainland , but from the secessionist activities carried out by the taiwan authorities . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the separatist forces of UNK of taiwan independence are the direct causes of the destruction of the relations between the two sides and the peace of the taiwan sea . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the taiwan authorities rejected the mainland 's opposition to the UNK of taiwan independence , the maintenance of taiwan 's stability and the taiwan strait as a pretext for launching a referendum . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this is UNK , UNK , and is a continuation of the separatist path UNK sympathy and support . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in any case , the taiwan authorities ' leaders claimed that the referendum was on the verge of confrontation between the two sides . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this is contrary to the popular opinion of taiwan compatriots seeking peace , stability and development , rather than the deepening of the UNK of taiwan . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> reviewing the historical process of the development of the chinese nation , unity is always the mainstream , and it is UNK and UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> with the growing strength of the motherland , the cooperation between the two sides has been increasing , and the international community has generally acknowledged the consolidation of a chinese pattern , which is doomed to failure . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> more than two weeks of the lunar new year is one of the traditional festivals that chinese people attach great importance to . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in this exciting day , we are used to friends with friends , exchange gifts , in order to form . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the hongkong post , in line with the spirit of " UNK , UNK " , carries out this " gift - bearing service " for the hong kong people . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the hongkong post has been committed to cooperating with other postal administrations and providing international logistic service . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> as early as december 2 in the second half of the year , december launched the UNK logistics services with the australian postal service to provide quality products for hong kong people . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this time , we have been working closely with china post and the postal service to promote the market demand of the hong kong people or their customers . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> first , the first batch of gifts for the delicate packaging , including the candy bar , the contents of the candy bar , tea , and so on . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> no matter to relatives or friends sent to the mainland , or business partners , are very decent gifts . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> over the past 30 years , the UNK has made obvious contributions to the protection of consumer rights and interests . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> to evaluate the effectiveness of UNK 's work , it is best to see whether the interests of consumer interests are substantially improved. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i quite agree with president chen 's statement that after 30 years , not only did consumers know their rights and interests , they also valued consumer interests , which was the result of government efforts . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK regularly tests the product and conducts market surveys and research on different products and services , and publishes fair and objective market information through the monthly magazine . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> " choosing the monthly magazine " is trusted by the public , and now " choose " the monthly development online edition , which will play a more effective role in helping consumers become more user - friendly to obtain market information . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK has 11 regional consumer advisory centres and 16 telephone hotlines to provide consumers with information on goods and services and on consumer complaints . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> since its inception , the query has been increasing , up from UNK in the early 1970 s , an increase of over 20 times and an increasing number of consumer products and services . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in addition , more than 26 , 000 complaints were handled this year . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK will also be named individual to manage the shop , which can assist consumers to guard against fraud , the operator also has a certain deterrent effect . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i told you that i was watching tv very carefully and later on , i made a lot of reflections and saw that the public was dissatisfied with the demands of the government . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in this regard , the government and i have been working hard over the past six months , and we have made a lot of efforts in this regard . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i have a clear understanding of the democratic aspirations of society . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but , senator yang , i want to tell you what i 'm doing is to make sure everything goes well in the wake of the constitutional review , so we 'll have to solve some basic problems . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> what are the basic questions ? <EOS2> 
<EOS1> some of the problems in principle , some of which are related to the law , are related to the constitutional review of the basic law . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we are working on this part of the work of a group of three people in this regard . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it will consult the central committee and hear your views in hong kong , and i think it is a good step for us to take note of the views of the hong kong society . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in today 's competitive business environment , brand is playing a key role in product success . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> to create brand name is not one day can be done , must have a creative design , excellent quality , rich thoughts of packaging , effective marketing and continuous investment . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> hong kong has conditions for creating famous brands . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we have a wealth of knowledge , skills and experience from design , manufacture , marketing to management , and we have broad market . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in addition to the zero tariff preferences that enter the mainland market , its biggest advantage is to encourage businessmen to use more personal ideas and work harder to improve the value added. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> " hong kong 's top ten brand - name election , " the chinese manufacturers will promote the development of hong kong products to the UNK direction of the development of hong kong . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> over the past five years , the elections have led to the creation of 51 " top ten brands of hong kong " . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , in the face of the huge market in the mainland , 51 of the 51 famous brands are really nothing , we need hundreds , thousands , more more " hong kong - famous brands . " <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the hong kong metro has been actively involved in metro projects in major cities in the interior over the years , giving them a wealth of experience in hong kong through the services of the mainland market . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i am very glad to have the investment , professional services and quality control of hong kong in the domestic market . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the exchange of this type of shenzhen can not only help the development of our country , but also create more opportunities for the development of the economy . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i would like to thank the central government and the government of shenzhen special economic zone for their policy support in this project . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> mtr company for the first time out of hong kong , in the form of investment in the domestic mtr development , further to bring hong kong 's brand into the country , this is really exciting and domestic people feel happy . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i wish the shenzhen rail transit 4 th to achieve the early approval of the central government approval , the project is smooth , the two days after the shenzhen two days more exchanges and cooperation . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> today is the beginning of the year at the beginning of the year , i am pleased to receive the gold and silver trade field an invitation , attend your new year of the chinese new year , and host the new year of the new year of the 
<EOS1> first of all , i would like to congratulate you , i wish you all the spirit of the dragon , when you come to , UNK , UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the surge in gold prices over the past few years has seen more recent breakthroughs at $ 400 per game , and the momentum continues to be strong , reflecting investors ' confidence in gold . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i believe that the industry is very busy in the past year . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in fact , in addition to the external factors , the city road UNK also reflect the gold and silver industry over the past 90 years of effort to manage the results . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> these efforts not only lay the foundation stone of hong kong , but also contributed a lot to the consolidation of the position of the hong kong international financial centre . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the so - called " year plan " , i hope that the industry of gold and silver trade will continue to work in the coming year , seize the gold time of the industry and gold industry , and seize the demand for gold trade from the mainland 
<EOS1> i am confident that with the active promotion of the positive side of the industry , the hong kong people 's republic of hong kong will be able to play a large part in the coming year . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> finally , i wish the city of UNK is active , prosperous , business is flourishing . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> thank you guys . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , in the past , the challenges of the past , not only in the financing of public housing , were also significant . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> financial crisis broke out in 1997 , the asset bubble burst , causing property prices seven to large , causing the owners hit , and the past five years deflation aggravated the main reason . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> now we are determined to maintain a stable environment and ensure a sound development of the property market . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> healthy property markets , indeed , are crucial to the continued recovery of the hong kong economy . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we also committed to protecting and improving the living environment . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> our future work will be based on the principle of sustainable development , with better urban design and better protection of the natural landscapes and monuments of heritage sites in hong kong . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we will pay attention to the overall environmental problem . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> last year , the lessons learned from the outbreak of UNK disease in hong kong reminded us of the need to build a more spacious and clean environment . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we enhance the UNK of the environment , trees , additional parks and recreation facilities to facilitate the enjoyment of citizens . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i would like to express my gratitude to you for your views on the administration of the chief executive 's report on the administration of justice and legal , constitutional , civil service and fund employees and security . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> only members of parliament and members of parliament , in the areas of justice and legal services , are members of the legislative council and vice - chairman of the legislative council . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the chief executive has proposed a number of measures to promote the governance of the government , including strengthening the links between key officials and society , increasing public policy research , strengthening cooperation between the government and the legislative council , and serious political review . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the department of justice will be fully engaged in the work of ensuring compliance with the laws and procedures , in particular the basic law , including the fundamental rights and freedoms of citizens , as well as the maintenance of the rule of law and the independence of 
<EOS1> as the main official , i will make every effort to understand the views of the public and the legal community on matters affecting the judiciary and the legal profession . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> for example , the arrangements for closer economic and trade relations between the mainland and hong kong are the result of close cooperation between the government and the industry , including the UNK and the bar . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we have succeeded in incorporating the UNK law into the service industry of the mainland , which provides a new platform for enhancing cooperation between the two legal services . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the work of the task force is two - way , and we will reflect the work of the public opinion in hong kong . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> from mid - january this year to the present , we have received more than ten groups and personalities . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we are fully receptive to the political development needs of hong kong , which need to be consistent with the " one country , two systems " , which is the central government . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> most of them think that the political system of hong kong requires improvement , but at the same time , everyone agrees with the basic law . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> groups and personalities have their views on individual programs and legal issues . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the task force will be able to turn these wills into the central committee . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the coming months , the task force will continue to meet with other groups and personalities , and we will receive the views that will be received from the central committee . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this time , the first meeting of the task force and the central government departments , we still need to continue to follow up and communicate with the central government . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i am confident that we all understand that the political development of the central and regional relations , the central committee has a review of the development of the UNK UNK , we need to consult with the central committee . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the west kowloon cultural district is a major cultural and art programme that has never been made in hong kong . it is a plan not only for the public but also of the public and the metropolitan . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the construction of the west kowloon cultural district is part of the whole society of hong kong . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the government must continue to engage in deep discussion with the community in all its aspects and ideas . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we understand that not only the building of the building , but also the economic benefits can be achieved , sustainable development , to enhance the quality of life of citizens . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the government attaches great importance to the software supporting of the west kowloon cultural district , which must be matched by related measures , including the management policies of the facility , the promotion strategy of literary and art programmes , the content of the performance exhibition and the 
<EOS1> the formulation of these relevant strategies must be carefully listened to " use " . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the younger generation of young people , including you , each of the young people you are sitting in , will be one of the leading players in the kowloon west kowloon cultural district . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we hope that this region can flourish , no matter whether the hong kong people or the local visitors , whether the older generation or the lively young people , can be UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i know you have discussed several different areas of the west kowloon cultural and art district this morning , and some students spent a lot of effort to produce a special report . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i can't wait to hear the outcome of your discussions and exchange ideas with you . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> since the sept 11 attacks , global attention has focused on ports , airports and border security . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> as the first u . s . container exported to the u . s . container , hong kong is undoubtedly a rapid response to the port safety initiative . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in addition , we believe that the disruption of the lives of terrorist organizations is an effective means of curbing terror . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> massive sums of money flowing into the global financial system have been UNK by law enforcement agencies that have committed crimes and UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> as the main asian financial centre , we believe that the UNK of terrorists is perhaps one of the most effective ways to combat its architecture . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the legislative organs of hong kong are currently discussing various proposals to tighten the existing legislation on the financing of terrorist activities and to cooperate actively with international standards and circumstances , such as the revision of the new recommendations of the special economic and trade organization for combating 
<EOS1> in addition , we are seeking to create better information disclosure legislation in order to report suspicious transactions to institutions and personalities . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the " balance " is also the key to work in this regard : the efficiency of the effective investigation powers , the freedom of the UNK , the privacy of the individual , the efficiency of the economic and financial system . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> our control measures are based on the rule of law , transparency , fairness and efficiency . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in fact , services in hong kong have an advantage in UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the professional and business talents of hong kong have an indepth knowledge of the commercial operation of the international and the mainland . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> professional services such as accounting , finance , law and arbitration in hong kong are the best partners in the process of internationalization and world market integration . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> as for our transport , construction , design and marketing , management consultants , information technology , conference and exhibition services , we will help to enhance the overall productivity and competitiveness of mainland companies and to assist enterprises and products in developing their brand image . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> tourism , health care , insurance and other services , more conducive to the development of the mainland - related market and industry , upgrading service level . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the close cooperation between the two services will greatly enhance the respective advantages of the two sides and help to meet the opportunities and challenges of economic globalization . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in order to promote the development of professional services in the mainland market , the financial secretary and the secretary of the financial secretary and my counterparts in the policy bureau and the previous professional sector are engaged in discussions of the professional qualification and other industry . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it is very glad to have the qualifications and cooperation agreements signed in the three fields of architecture , structural engineering and insurance , and to the development of the industry in the mainland market . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> through this meeting , professional groups in hong kong established closer ties with the mainland regulators , providing a sound basis for the next phase of friendly cooperation . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i believe most of hong kong people love the motherland and hong kong . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> china and hong kong in the economic , social , political , cultural ties and relations , in fact , before , return , have been very close , are closely linked. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on the economic side , we have seen the promotion of the reform and opening up of the four modernizations and the drive for reform and opening up more than 20 years ago , and that hong kong has a new space for development . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in recent days , we have further opportunities to follow the arrangements of the central committee of the central committee of the central committee of hong kong and the mainland . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the area of social development , we have seen a thousand years of national development in recent years . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> hong kong people saw beijing 's successful bid to host the 2008 olympic games . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> just a few months ago , UNK visited hong kong with the same joy as hong kong people . why ? <EOS2> 
<EOS1> because we feel that the country can accomplish this , everyone and every hong kong citizen feel proud . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i know that the legislative council has been discussing with the government about a decade ago in the legislative council . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> similarly , the government has considered , over the last decade or so , a long - term plan to relocate government headquarters . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i understand , therefore , that the government has been disappointed by the government 's decision to rein in the UNK development of the new legislative building block . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i understand that members will continue to work in poor areas of the environment for some time . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , as i said to government colleagues that have been affected by the same decision , it is hoped that the wider public interest can be used to understand the situation and , during that period , be patient . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i explained several times earlier that the financial situation of the government following the current financial situation and the outbreak of sars last year was not an appropriate time for the UNK project or large - scale construction of the office building . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the construction of the new legislative council , after UNK , will help to reduce the government 's fiscal pressures in the coming years and meet the public , as well as the public . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at a time when the government is going to improve the public financial situation , the new legislative building on the development of the new legislative council , which is now being planned for us . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the state is very concerned about hong kong , the president and the prime minister are very concerned about hong kong . i know that they and the central government will do everything possible to do the job well . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> therefore , whether in tourism , finance , infrastructure coordination , UNK , product tariffs and services , good news will come . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i also hope that with the recovery of hong kong 's economic recovery , hong kong can make a greater contribution to the development of the country . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> during my meeting with premier wen jiabao , he also congratulated hong kong on his remarkable achievements over the last very difficult year , and despite the challenges ahead , you all listened to his report . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> premier wen jiabao also told me that a review of mr. deng xiaoping 20 years ago on the " one country , two systems " was important for us to understand the principle of " one country , two systems " . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> he also said that hong kong people really want to seize this opportunity to focus on the development of the good economy , do a good job , he is confident of hong kong . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> later i will meet with the secretary of the province of guangdong , mr. UNK , and the prefect of the city of guangdong province , to explore with them how to build a higher level of cooperation on the basis of the existing bases . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the last point is the UNK of the UNK , which is designed to govern hong kong with the UNK of the UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> for those who are patriotic , it is a clear standard that we must respect the patriots of their own people , and support the country for the restoration of sovereignty over hong kong . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i have to reiterate that the citizens of hong kong are patriotic . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this is not the general public of hong kong , but a member of the public who is involved in the management of public affairs in hong kong . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the light of the basic law of the people 's republic of china , they are sworn in in accordance with the basic law of the people 's republic of china and the hong kong special administrative region of the people 's republic of china . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the five , six principles and important considerations i have said about the future of hong kong in the late 1980 s , and the enactment of the joint declaration and the basic law , will not change , nor change . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the intellectual property rights system was born in centuries , especially since the industrial revolution , one of the most significant inventions that had epoch - making significance were created. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> over the past 20 years , the intellectual property system has played an important role in the process of revitalizing the economy and enhancing international competitiveness by becoming the basic legal system and important policy instruments for countries to promote technological innovation . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at present , with the rapid development of science and technology and economic globalization , the creation , possession and application of knowledge and intellectual resources , the quantity and quality of intellectual property rights , has become an important basis for countries to participate in international competition . 
<EOS1> therefore , strengthening the international exchange and cooperation of intellectual property protection is of great importance for the establishment of a just and fair international economic order and the promotion of world economic prosperity and development . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the chinese government attached great importance to the protection of intellectual property rights . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the beginning of reform and opening up , our country began to build intellectual property rights system , after more than 20 years of effort , has formed a relatively complete legal system of intellectual property rights , the establishment of a combination of justice and administrative law 
<EOS1> in the 21 st century , the revolution of science and technology will drive the development of productive forces with unprecedented tremendous power . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> to further improve the system of intellectual property rights in our country , strengthen the international exchange and cooperation of intellectual property rights protection , is the demand of the new century to expand the opening of our country , and the need to build a socialist modernization country 
<EOS1> we are ready to work with the rest of the world to build a just and rational intellectual property system conducive to promoting the knowledge of the technological and economic development of all nations , and striving for the creation of a favorable environment for the creation of intellectual 
<EOS1> accelerating the construction of the organization is the first task facing the shanghai cooperation organization . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> despite the efforts of the parties , considerable progress had been made in the preparations for the preparation of the secretariat and the regional counter - terrorism bodies . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we will redouble our efforts to ensure the formal launching of the secretariat in this year and the early establishment of regional anti - terrorist bodies . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in order to reflect the importance attached to the sco secretarygeneral , the chinese government decided to provide the secretariat with free access to the secretariat . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the future , we will continue to provide significant support for the smooth functioning of the secretariat . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> deepening and expanding security cooperation has been the focus of the shanghai cooperation organization . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we must not be able to relax and be less vigilant in respect of the UNK forces that seriously endanger the interests of member states in the region . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we should carry out long - standing unremitting efforts to eradicate these evil forces and effectively safeguard the peace and stability of the region . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in order to cut off the source of funds from the UNK forces , we should strike up the agenda of cooperation on security cooperation as soon as possible . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> economic cooperation is the important foundation and priority direction of the shanghai cooperation organization . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> education is the cornerstone of modern civilization . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the improvement of the national quality , the enhancement of the comprehensive national power and the development of education should be developed. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> rural education is widely influenced by the rural economy and social development . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> since the reform and opening up , china 's urban and rural areas have undergone tremendous and profound changes , which is inseparable from the development of education especially in rural areas . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the rural areas , there is a great leap in the responsibility system of the family and the productive forces . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> one of the basic reasons is that hundreds of millions of rural workers in the rural areas and the rural masses are supporting the rural labors . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at present , china 's agricultural and rural economy are in the crucial stage of development , the development of quality , efficient , ecological and safe agriculture , the expansion of agricultural industrialization , the transfer of surplus rural labor force , and so on . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the rising of the new technological revolution in the world and the advancing of a well - UNK society of a well - off society offer a higher demand for the quality of the population and the quality of thought and morality of the rural population . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it is difficult to achieve a comprehensive well - off without a comprehensive improvement in the quality of farmers without the overall improvement of the quality of the peasants . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we must fully understand the fundamental and guiding role of rural education in building well - off society in an all - round way . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the advisers and guests at the conference are senior leaders of multinational companies , with international renowned economic experts , experts and scholars who are UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i deeply feel the spirit of sincere cooperation and the positive and practical attitude of the various advisers . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> to give full play to our spirit of cooperation and our collective wisdom is not only conducive to the planning and promotion of guangdong development , but also conducive to promoting mutual cooperation and development in each other . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i have been looking forward to the 2003 international advisory meeting on the economic development of guangdong , listen to and understand your economic and social development of guangdong province . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we are here today to share a common goal of enhancing cooperation , expanding the space for development and enhancing the economic and social development of guangdong . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> china 's accession to the wto marked the opening of a new phase , and we are engaged in international competition at a broader , broader and higher level . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> guangdong is the highest economic UNK in china 's provinces , has been the first to experience unprecedented development opportunities and serious challenges . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in this context , we must seize new opportunities , meet new challenges , fully upgrade international competitiveness , actively promote the modernization drive and work towards a new level of economic cooperation . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the guangdong people are now concentrating on building a welloff society in an allround way , accelerating modernization and creating more opportunities and space for all our friends . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the guangdong economy , full of vibrant vigor and promising prospects , is UNK across the new height . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> a step - by - step approach was announced by the iraqi provisional authority and the us occupation authorities in baghdad on the timetable for the transfer of authority over iraq next year . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the agreement was accepted by the international community , while the french council said that the u . n . secretary - general kofi annan said that the un secretary - general annan was not yet ripe for his role in iraq . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the iraqi people reacted coldly to u . s . public opinion that UNK was a major gamble . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in any case , people are more UNK , just wait and see . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the international community is skeptical and UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> because people see that the administration of iraq is not the united states of america , the transfer of power can not be complete , it will leave a lot of UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> first , the transitional government set up in may of next year was not elected directly by the people of iraq , but was elected by the UNK national congress elected by the 18 provincial election committee . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it is difficult to avoid being UNK by the us , whose legitimacy may be questioned. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> second , after the united states has announced the power of the u . s . troops do not withdraw , it is only the original military occupation of the military forces into the military UNK military presence . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on november 18 th , the u . s . government announced a decision to impose quota restrictions on textiles , UNK , gowns , imported from china . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it is deeply regrettable that the u . s . government 's trade protectionism cannot help china to expand economic cooperation and trade between the two countries . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the development of economy globalization to today , the united states UNK to chinese textile imports UNK appear extremely inappropriate . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> first of all , such abuse of the UNK cap limits the implementation of the wto 's principles of free trade . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on the one hand , UNK talks about the free trade of UNK , on the other hand , on the other hand , it is not only too arbitrary , nor too arbitrary . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> secondly , the UNK limit has limited the momentum of the good development of chinaus trade and commerce . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> since 1999 , china and the united states reached an average annual growth of 15 % in the u . s . since china entered into wto in 1999 . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in september this year , the u . s . and china exported UNK % yearonyear to china . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> over the past two years , textile raw materials and manufactured goods in the united states have exported significantly to china . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> indeed , today china has become the nation 's fastest export growth in the world . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> there are many reasons for bush 's visit to britain , which is the only superpower in the world since the end of the cold war . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the u . s . has not been authorized by the united states to launch a war on iraq and not respect the main allies in international issues of reconstruction in iraq . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> a survey by the european commission revealed that 68 per cent of the european union 's citizens believed that the reason for the iraq war was inadequate , and 53 per cent believed that the united states posed a threat to world peace . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> second , the u . s . stressed the fight against terrorism , and it was important that the allies should donate money rather than money . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> for the iraq reconstruction project , the u . s . UNK UNK is in the hands of his first bid for the first tender contract to the country 's companies , rather than UNK a slice of the iron and steel trade disputes , the world trade organization 
<EOS1> third , the u . s . has taken its national values as the highest principle , insisting on democratic transformation of the middle east states , and some allies asked america to respect the culture and identity of islamic countries . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> bush , however , would not have been UNK by wide criticism and opposition , and he again defended his policy in iraq during his visit and stressed that u . s . - british troops would continue to take force against violence in his country . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> given president bush 's visit to britain , the situation in iraq is unlikely to go as far as the white house wants . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> after half a year of debate , japan 's self - defense forces UNK at the end of 2003 before the end of iraq . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it was japan 's first international war since the end of the second world war . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it reflects the will of japan towards the political military powers and marks a shift in the country 's defence strategy . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the reason for this action is that it is not an isolated incident . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the japan armed forces , through the war in afghanistan , made a breakthrough for the defense of the reconstruction of iraq by using the basic plan of UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this step is followed by a breakthrough in the constitutional limits of the japanese peace constitution and the realization of the UNK overseas battlefield . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in addition , japan was prepared to revise the concept of the basic defence forces in 2004 , with a view to UNK the laws of the overseas chinese laws and the perpetuation of the law , as well as being prepared for the establishment of a permanent , 
<EOS1> at the same time , the japanese council of ministers adopted the decision to deploy the missile defence system on the ground that the north korean missile threat UNK , which was launched in early 2004 , with the introduction of the u . s . s . 3 
<EOS1> it is not hard to see that the japanese self - defense forces are being developed in the direction of the regular army of UNK and attack . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> japan 's actions have been of concern first and foremost because of the impact of these military decisions on the peace constitution of japan . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> mr koizumi , after visiting the yasukuni shrine , received interviews from japanese journalists and defended his actions . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the defense of the word is contradictory . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the reporter asked why he visited koizumi , UNK koizumi 's peace and prosperity was achieved on the basis of war casualties . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i visited japan for peace and prosperity in japan . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK , UNK koizumi 's so - called UNK war victims also include the first class of the second world war ii war ii war criminals . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the end of the war , peace and prosperity in japan after the war of japan also made the base contribution of the first class war criminals . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> reporter asked , why to choose january 1 st to visit the yasukuni shrine <EOS2> 
<EOS1> koizumi said that the first day of the new year travel to god shrine is japan 's tradition , many people on this day to worship . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> ordinary people mourn their loved ones and friends , and a lot of them express that they visit yasukuni shrine only to mourn families and friends , and firmly reject the yasukuni shrine offering serie a a war war . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the chinese people are justified , and we have always adhered to the distinction between the japanese and the few UNK that separate ordinary people from right - wing ones , and ordinary people 's visits to yasukuni shrine is not the root of history . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> unity is power . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this is the truth of UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> to achieve the grand goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all - round way , the sacred cause of the great rejuvenation of the chinese nation must unite with all forces that can unite . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the new stage of the new century , the work of the patriotic united front and the work of the people 's political consultative conference must be used as a basic starting point and UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we must further consolidate and improve the system of multiparty cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the communist party of china , further consolidate and develop the united front of patriotic unity , the most extensive and most extensive and all positive factors . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> over the past year , the cppcc has been firmly seized of the two main themes of unity and democracy and earnestly fulfilled various functions and played an important role in promoting the overall development of our country 's economic and social development and maintaining the stability of reform 
<EOS1> in the new year , the people 's committee of the chinese people 's political consultative conference , the central committee of the communist party of china , the cpc central committee and the cpc central committee of the cpc central committee and the cpc central committee and the 
<EOS1> the UNK summit of the south asian association for regional cooperation , held in islamabad on 4 and 6 january , was held in islamabad with the ratification of the south asia free trade agreement framework treaty , the saarc protocol on the fight against terrorism and the south 
<EOS1> during the saarc summit , the prime minister of india , UNK UNK , and pakistani president UNK musharraf 's bilateral meeting was particularly notable . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the previous summit , mr musharraf and mr. UNK shook hands without making expectations of the development of bilateral relations . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> two years later , with the resumption of normal diplomatic relations between the two sides , relations between land and air and the implementation of a series of major initiatives such as the ceasefire in the kashmir region , the summit reached a high level meeting . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the two countries have made a big step in the process of improving bilateral relations , and the south asian region is taking a new turn . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> while the indian foreign minister , UNK UNK , said on the 4 th of the meeting , the meeting was held in UNK , but people believed the meeting meant india would continue to be UNK in a more active and pragmatic way . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the leaders of both countries are aware that tension and confrontation do not fit within the national interest and that the opportunities for economic development are UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> with the further development of economic globalization , cooperation and revitalization of the economy have become the top priority of both governments . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> despite the fact that the presidential election held by georgia was not yet in official position , the candidate nominated by the right - wing party and the leader of the national movement of the national movement have been concluded. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on july 7 th , the central election commission announced that more than 95 % of the electorate had supported UNK according to statistics of 89 % . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> some heads of state of the cis countries have also sent a message to the young politician . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in fact , as early as the end of the election night , UNK had announced his victory . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> he said the result was a victory for the UNK people and said that georgia will act quickly to create a new future . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> many voters said in an interview with the media that the ballot papers to vote for UNK means choosing the new hope of UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> even the former president , UNK UNK , who was forced to resign , expressed his support for the old man and praised his youth for his youth , his energetic and motivated education . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> while there is hope in UNK , it is also noted that the situation in georgia has not changed significantly in the months following the resignation of UNK UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it can be said that the newly elected president will face the same old problem . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the past year has been an important and unusual year in our development . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we fought with the sudden outbreak of sars , made the rapid progress of the chinese economy maintained good momentum , the gross domestic product per capita of 1000 u . s . s . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> our achievements in various aspects of our country have been remarkable , and the people of the whole country have paid great pains to show the courage and power of the people of the world to show the courage and strength of the people of the world . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> looking forward to the new year , we are confident and hopeful . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> our country is in a strategic opportunity period which must be tightly seized and UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we must adhere to the spirit of deng xiaoping 's theory of deng xiaoping 's theory and the third plenary session of the cpc central committee . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> to do so this year , we must correctly seize the situation , to see favorable conditions and new opportunities , and to see adverse conditions and new challenges , enhance responsibility , sense of urgency and sense of responsibility . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the tripartite talks on iraq held at united nations headquarters in new york on 19 th , united nations secretary - general kofi annan held consultations with representatives of iraqi governing council and british coalition provisional authority . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the talks touched on the political , humanity and security of iraq and the appointment of the united nations special representative in iraq . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it is remarkable whether the united nations is involved in the reconstruction of iraq and how the united nations is involved in the reconstruction of iraq in the wake of iraq 's transfer of power to iraq . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> since the u . s . announcement of the main war in iraq since early may last year , the situation in iraq has been volatile and opposed to the occupation , which has killed and injured u . s . and british coalition casualties . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> iraqi former iraqi president saddam opened the net at 13 december last year , but the joy of the united states was not lasting and the security situation failed to get better and the resistance was UNK the occupation authorities were in trouble . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on the other hand , the iraqi population and arab countries unanimously called for the withdrawal of the military forces of the people of iraq and the government of iraq to manage their country . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the same time , the u . s . and the british seek to reshape the iraqi regime in accordance with its own will and step up from the UNK and UNK of UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> for this reason , the way and process of devolution is the focus of the current iraqi affairs . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in july this year , the government of the united states and the british government , which formed a transitional government of interim government of iraq , formed by 1 july this year , will be elected by the UNK transitional national congress . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> while the majority of the population of iraq , in turn , emphasized that there should be universal direct universal suffrage in iraq . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> secretary of state colin powell 's visit to russia is still a focus of public opinion . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this is because the two countries of the united states and russia are so important that their relations are far - reaching for the world today . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> more importantly , powell 's moscow trip was rich in substance and conveyed a clear signal that the u . s . s . - american relations of UNK appeared cloudy . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the outlook for the relations between the two countries will likely become bleak , if not dispersed in a timely manner . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> despite the smooth passage of the channels of dialogue between washington and moscow , powell decided to present his position in russia 's UNK UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> powell noted in the article that the u . s . has been puzzled by a series of events in the russian interior and foreign affairs over the next few months . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> he believed that the russian regime had not yet been fully embraced by the law and that the key elements of civil society such as freedom of the press and the development of political parties were inadequate . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the policy of russia in chechnya and its attitude towards the neighbouring countries of the commonwealth is a matter of concern to the united states . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the view of diplomats , the use of mass media to make public statements is the latest way of communicating information . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it is evident that the intention of the united states to choose this option is evident . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK international UNK u . s . flu epidemic reached peaks <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the u . s . center for disease control and prevention of the u . s . center for disease control and prevention on 31 december said the u . s . has reached a peak of 45 % of the nation 's 50 th . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> according to the statistics of the centre on 20 december , the death toll from the death toll in the united states recorded a record of 7.8 per cent of all deaths in the same period . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at least 42 children were killed in the united states at least , and the death toll was rapidly rising , but not yet accurate . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> experts believe that the virus spread in 2003 has caused two reasons : flu virus is not a popular flu virus in panama , which prevented the production of vaccines in the early years . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> although america 's average of UNK people die from the flu every year , UNK people are hospitalized because of the flu , but a certain amount of social panic is still rampant . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> william thompson , the american expert on the pandemic , believed the pandemic was the worst of more than 30 years and was much earlier than in previous years , with the spread of flu in many schools . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the face of such a dire situation , the united states health ministry launched the emergency disposal centre on 19 december and sent its medical expert team to the states . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> recently , some parts of our country have taken up the epidemic of highly pathogenic avian influenza . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the central committee of the communist party of the state council and the state council have attached great importance to this issue and made a series of major decisions concerning the policy and policy measures of prevention and control . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> various localities and departments concerned with emergency action to prevent the spread of the epidemic in accordance with the instructions of the cpc central committee and the state council . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at present , the national control of avian influenza is being carried out in an orderly and orderly way . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the high pathogenic avian influenza is a kind of animal epidemic disease which is spreading fast and dangerous . it is seriously endangering the production of animal husbandry and seriously harms the people 's health and safety . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the prevention and control of highly pathogenic avian influenza is concerned with the health and safety of the masses , the development of agriculture and farmers ' income , the global economic development , the social stability and the prevention and control . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> as the world 's largest debtor , the foreign debt of the united states is increasing . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> treasury issued on january 16 th , up to $ UNK trillion in debt owed by the united states to foreign creditors by the end of september , up 2.2 % over the previous figure . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on average , every american has more than 20 , 000 dollars in foreign debt . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> surprisingly , a study released by the international monetary fund in the past week sounded a grim alarm at the financial base of u . s . UNK and pointed to the threat of global financial stability . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> according to statistics , foreign private investors controlled roughly 40 % of u . s . government bonds . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this is reminiscent of the 20 th - century UNK that keynes gave to president roosevelt for fiscal policy stimulus to stimulate the economy , the fiscal deficit was UNK through external borrowing . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this action has played a significant role in stimulating the effective demand of UNK , in order to solve the economic crisis . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , it is seen that the u . s . government of america has tended to act as a panacea for UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but since president reagan 's reform in the 1980 s , the us fiscal deficit gradually increased and eventually became the biggest debtor . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the convening of the first round of the sixparty talks was a significant step forward in the peaceful resolution of the korean peninsula nuclear issue . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> some of the common points raised during the talks have laid the foundations necessary for the continuation of the talks and further UNK the objectives , ways and guidelines of resolving the korean peninsula nuclear issue . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the past few months the parties have adhered to the peaceful resolution of the korean peninsula nuclear issue through dialogue , and , on the basis of the results of the first round of the six - party talks , conducted various levels of coordination consultations , and 
<EOS1> at the same time , it further demonstrates the flexibility of different degrees . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the preparations for the talks have made significant progress , and the talks have been fruitful . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> what can be achieved in the second round of the six - party talks will lead to the continuation of the peace talks process and the general interest of the parties concerned and the international community . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in response , the chinese foreign ministry spokesman said the goal of the sixparty talks was to maintain and advance the peace process of dialogue , and we would like to work with the parties . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> china 's basic starting point is to maintain peace and stability on the korean peninsula and achieve denuclearization of the peninsula . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> china is of the view that , as long as the parties adhered to and talked about good faith , mutual respect and consultation , equal consultations could create favorable conditions for the resolution of the relevant issues . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the late 1970 s and the late 1970 s , the relationship between the united states and the united states deteriorated in 1981 . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the president of the u . s . president reagan UNK a long list of charges , such as accusing the UNK of developing nuclear weapons , foreign military intervention and terrorism . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the two sides have been transferred from the east to the west , the united states to start the UNK prairie fire and the golden canyon of the golden canyon twice before the operation of two surgical attacks . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> since then , the united states has imposed sanctions on the economy on the political side of the country , politically and politically in the united states . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the gaddafi under pressure did not bow . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the moment , the u . s . - UNK relations have been warmer , and this is entirely due to the deterrent effect of the iraq war , which seems to be UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in fact , over the years , the unique UNK gaddafi and the united states , the other side has been thrown into the united states of america , but not response . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> after the end of the iraq war , the parties to the middle east have revised their strategies and UNK their regional powers to provide the best chance for UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> for gaddafi , with the united states , can put an end to the sanctions , revitalize the economy , and improve people 's livelihood , from isolation , into the international community . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> to give up things that have not been made available at the same time can be replaced by a new environment of UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> from 7 to 8 february , european and american dignitaries gathered in munich , germany , and the rest of the world to attend the 40 th munich security policy conference . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the so - called security policy meeting in munich was a forum for international security issues financed by german officials and supported by the government of germany , which was widely acclaimed as the UNK davos forum in the security field in recent years . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> an important topic of the conference was trans - atlantic relations . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the comments from european and american politicians show that the two sides are struggling to get rid of the spectre of the war between iraq and iraq and work back on the track of cooperation . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the president of the berlin international and security institute , UNK UNK , said this is a meeting of the european and american repair relations , which both sides have UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> for the u . s . and european relations , the new information that emerged from the meeting is that the united states and the european states need to resume dialogue and that there is a need for serious consideration of the common tasks facing both sides and finding 
<EOS1> compared with last year 's conference , the UNK of this year 's session disappeared and the positions of both sides were close . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK , who is represented by UNK , despite the fact that the u . s . war on iraq , still UNK , said it wanted to look ahead . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> " we must work together to ensure peace and peace in iraq , " said german foreign minister UNK UNK at the conference . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> he also said that although germany is not going to iraq , germany will not impede the direct role of nato in iraq . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the modern media , the united states UNK a large part of the international news discourse power , which has been widely disseminated worldwide , to the extent of UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> according to the person in charge of UNK tv station no . 1 , it is necessary to provide a comprehensive and impartial news platform for arab countries . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , analysts pointed out that UNK is a strategic weapon for u . s . public opinion penetration , cultural intrusion and UNK by the united states . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in this way , UNK liberty no . 1 mission uncommon mission , the choice of the speaker is almost three : one is to spread the concept of UNK liberal ideas . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the view of the united states , islamic civilization is a serious obstacle to western civilization , and the extremist religious influence in the islamic state of the middle east is the breeding ground for international terrorism , which is the main feature of anti - america , 
<EOS1> the united states has tried to instil the influence of its ideology into the arabs through the UNK of a UNK program . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> second , to improve america 's image . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the united states pursues unilateralism unilaterally , on a series of international issues UNK , UNK , his high - handed acts order the arab states and the islamic world with great anger . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> after the events of UNK UNK , the conflict between israel and the middle east islamic world became more and more UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the absence of conclusive evidence and a mandate from the united states to eliminate weapons of mass destruction and the name of the fight against terrorism , the united states has taken over iraq and provoked a strong dislike from the muslim community . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the talks between pakistani and indian officials took place in islamabad on february 16 th to 18 th , and the hope of peace was rising on the south asian continent . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> officials of the two countries identified the schedule and model of future talks , set up a mechanism for continuing dialogue , which marked the resumption of the indian - indian dialogue process in the wake of the suspension of the two - year period . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> before the talks , though the two countries have been UNK by a series of goodwill gestures , analysts are still wary of the prospect of the peace process . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it is no wonder that the recent surge in relations between india and india seems that no one dare guarantee the sunlight on the table of the negotiation table and tomorrow will not turn into the UNK of the border . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , UNK UNK , the secretary of state for foreign affairs of pakistan , delivered a clear message that optimism was once again filled with optimism , with the eyes of those with long - term attention to the situation in south asia . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> first of all , the timetable set out in the talks is very operational , both of which not only identified specific time and issues of the talks , but also defined different levels of meeting according to the importance of the topic . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> secondly , the two sides drew on lessons learned from the talks led by the leaders of the two countries ' leaders at the summit of july 2001 to lead to the failure of the talks to take the course of the talks . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> once again , the two countries agreed that the war is not a good way to resolve the dispute , and that the two sides should be far from the war , which formed the basis for the future . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> a comprehensive and accurate understanding and follow - up of the two systems of one country , one country and another must unite the UNK and UNK UNK of the state of hong kong and the nation 's sovereign state . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> only in this way can we effectively safeguard the well - being of our compatriots in hong kong in order to meet the long - term interests of both the national and the entire population . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> since the reunification of hong kong , the central government has been firmly committed to the implementation of the two systems principle of the state of UNK , which is strictly in accordance with the basic law . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> our compatriots in hong kong enjoy unprecedented democratic rights . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> with the support of the central government and the mainland of china , hong kong has successfully challenged the risks and challenges of the asian financial crisis and continued to maintain the status of the international finance , trade and shipping centres . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> practice has proved that the two systems of one country , one country , two systems have a great vitality . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> today , the speech released by comrade deng xiaoping 20 years ago has once again demonstrated the strong resolve of the central government to implement the two systems of one country , one country , one country , one country , one country , one country and one country 
<EOS1> today , the central committee of the communist party of china and the state council are here to hold the national congress on science and technology awards . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> president hu jintao presented the award for the award of the highest science and technology award for 2003 . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the general conference awards for the national science and technology UNK of china 's manned space programme and the national natural science award for 2003 , the national technical engineer of the country and the national science and technology workers of the country . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on behalf of the central committee of the communist party of china , the state council has expressed a warm congratulations to all the people who have won the award . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> extending sincere greetings and high respect to the scientific and technological personnel of the various national fronts <EOS2> 
<EOS1> for the first 20 years of this century , for our country , it is a strategic opportunity period which must be held tightly and UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we will focus on building a moderately prosperous society that benefits more than a hundred billion people . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> with this strategic opportunity , we must strive to do something and must put the development of science and technology at a more prominent and prominent place . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the u . s . president george w . bush kicked off a pre - emptive strike strategy in june 2002 , which was put into practice in u . s . foreign relations and launched its first pre - emptive strike in iraq last march . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the concept of pre - emptive strike should not only be contrary to the norms of international law with respect for the sovereignty and territorial integrity of sovereignty and territorial integrity , and that the dangerous effects of succession , which will lead to the emergence of a new 
<EOS1> at the beginning of UNK 's pre - emptive strike theory , a number of american dignitaries raised the question : if other countries did what they could do , UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the first half of the year , the number of countries that claimed to have been pre - UNK to the pre - emptive strike was increasing . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this is a new trend deserving attention and research . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the month of mr bush 's pre - emptive strike strategy , howard UNK , the prime minister of australia , first stepped out . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> he said australia would take a pre - emptive strike against australia once the terrorists wanted to attack australia 's reliable intelligence , and would take military action around the country . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> he even recommended that the united nations charter should be incorporated into the charter of the united nations and that the united nations charter should be amended so that states would be pre - UNK to combat terrorists or those supporting terrorist activities . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in north - east asia , the defence office of japan raised the defence white paper , launched in july 1999 , that japan could strike a pre - emptive strike against a foreign base in the face of missile strikes or military incursions . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the aftermath of the iraq war , japan UNK the call for a proactive UNK strategy . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> recently , international public opinion has been a lot of american policy reviews in america . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> published in january this year , the " africa policy outlook for 2004 " , which has adversely affected the foreign policy of the bush administration over the past year , especially since the war on terror and the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it is also recalled that in january of last year , the bush administration helped to provide at least $ 3 billion worth of money to the president of the republic of africa for aids response . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> last july , president bush paid a visit to senegal , south africa , botswana , uganda and nigeria to help african countries with $ 15 bn worth of $ 15 billion to fight aids . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> those assistance programmes had once been welcomed by african countries , and it was widely praised at the international level . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> a year later , however , specific actions in the united states have been slow to implement . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> africa needs assistance . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> after entering the new century , africa is facing a variety of development challenges , and in order to reduce hunger and poverty , promote health and education , the african union of african union of the whole continent has been developing . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the united nations has repeatedly called on developed countries to devote 0.7 per cent of their gross domestic product to official assistance to the least developed countries . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , official united states assistance accounts for only 0.1 per cent of gross domestic product , a far cry from united nations requirements , the last of the donor countries . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> recently , european public opinion talks about a hot topic : german chancellor UNK UNK , french president jacques chirac and british prime minister tony blair have met with the prime minister of germany , UNK UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> public opinion UNK the big three giants known as the new troika of the european union , the three countries relations are known as the new UNK triangle UNK relations . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the new UNK triangle is a new thing to be seen , but whatever the point of view , in general , this new triangle will benefit europe 's integration process , which is conducive to european as a multi - polar world . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> throughout the european hundred years of history , the UNK triangle is a basic feature of the anglo - french law governing or resisting germany . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> two world wars . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> during the cold war , two germans were divided into nato and nato . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> after the end of the cold war , the unity of the united states was stronger , the western european power was UNK , french suspicion increased , causing the UNK axis to close again , and its intentions remained to contain german . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but in recent years , with the restart of the UNK UNK , and the fierce collision between the world single - polarization and multi - polarization concept , the eu has got bogged down in iraq . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the UNK , represented by german UNK and UNK UNK , who is represented in britain and poland , is opposed to the position in iraq . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this split coincides with the largest enlargement of the european union . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> egyptian president mubarak , speaking on the reform of the arab states at cairo , has criticised the outside world for imposing a single reform model for arab states and warning that such attempts could be counterproductive and counterproductive . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> he believed that the reform measures should be based on their respective characteristics , while the single reform model ignored the cultural background , social customs and religious identity of different countries . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the same time , he noted that the arab states welcomed outside the reform process , but that such efforts should recognize the different national circumstances and respect the will of nations , thereby facilitating the political , economic and cultural reform process of arab countries . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the words of the egyptian leader represent the common vision of the arab countries . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at present , under the pressure of counter - terrorism , non - proliferation and democratic reform , the middle east , one of the world 's hot spots , is brewing new unrest and will lead to new integration . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> after afghanistan and iraq , how the political reconstruction of iraq , which was once viewed as one of the UNK axes of the axis of evil , was UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the various forms of government and social model in the middle east will evolve UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this is not only of interest to the arab world and the international community , but also of america and its western allies . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> secretary of state colin powell , after a meeting with a visiting UNK in washington , d . c . , has reiterated that the u . s . plan to carry out western - style democracy and capitalism in iraq and the middle east is UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> he also stressed that we are considering what we can do and how to UNK these regimes . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> last year , the international olympic committee established the year of UNK culture and education . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> with the help of this opportunity , bocog has organized a series of educational activities aimed at disseminating advanced culture and popularizing the olympic knowledge . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> among them , the book of secondary school students ' olympic knowledge , which is mainly aimed at teenagers , is an important achievement . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this reading is mainly introduced by the way of telling the story system , which introduces the knowledge of the olympic movement and the essence of the olympic spirit . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> last year , beijing olympic committee specially designed for teenagers to use recycled paper , printed in beijing olympic emblem . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the idea of UNK green olympic games is to prepare and host the olympic games with the view of protecting the environment and protecting the ecological balance . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we hope that these classes will be able to regulate the behaviour of young students , which will gradually become the UNK and UNK of the concept of green olympic games in UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> education is one of the core elements of the olympic movement , and it is an important embodiment of the UNK of the olympic games . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the real purpose of the olympic movement is to educate young people in a new way and in a new way to promote the harmonious development of teenagers , thereby contributing to a peaceful and better world . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> therefore , the combination of sports and education not only expands new horizons for the development of education , but also makes the olympic movement more instructive . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK green olympic games is one of the three main concepts of beijing 2008 olympic games . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the core of the core is to improve the quality of the environment in the capital. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> environmental protection , improvement of urban and rural greening and the development of the environmental protection industry are needed to promote environmental awareness of the whole society and encourage the public to actively participate in activities to improve the ecological environment . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it is an important task of the 16 th cpc central committee in the third plenary session of the communist party of china to promote the comprehensive , coordinated and sustainable development of science . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we must pay great attention . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in order to achieve the goal of green olympic games , beijing has formulated the plan of action of the olympic games and the plan of ecological and environmental protection on the basis of the tenth plan and the application report . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the goals of the holding of a green olympic games will be implemented through systematic and systematic implementation . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on february 25 th , the u . s . department of state published the country 's human rights report 2003 , UNK the human rights situation in more than 190 countries and territories , including chinese and territories . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> of course , there is a huge improvement in the human rights situation , for example , afghanistan and iraq , but the u . s . military forces the overthrow of the former regime , the UNK of the first half of the UNK state . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> what about the human rights situation in the us ? <EOS2> 
<EOS1> as in previous years , the report did not send a single word . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on march 1 , china 's state council news office issued the u . s . human rights record in 2003 to make up the shortcomings of the u . s . human rights report . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> based on the facts , the article introduces the existing problems of human rights in america and the violation of human rights in other countries . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the american people have a tradition of good faith , the tradition of making mistakes and mistakes . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it is well known that george washington 's story of cutting cherry trees when he was young was a vivid example . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> now america is the only superpower in the world , but rather it is telling the truth . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> recently , there is a change in the story of china 's economic development . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on the contrary , today many of china 's report began to believe that china 's economic development has boosted the recovery of japan 's economy , which has become an important engine of japanese economy . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the united states newsweek recently said that china 's rise was an opportunity and not a threat to his country , especially its neighbors . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK , which has been widely used , was replaced by china 's UNK UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> china 's UNK UNK asserts that china 's development will pose a threat to his country , especially the neighbouring countries . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but this claim is not accepted by china 's neighbours . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> malaysia 's former prime minister , UNK UNK , has argued that asian nations do not need to be afraid of china 's growing military and economic strength , because china has no external tradition of conquest . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the ministry of defence of india , in its vision , also believes that china has no military threat to india . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in economy and trade , governments and businesses have made china 's best choice for the expansion of the market , with strategic vision overseas investors firmly committed to writing the chinese opportunities theory in the world top 500 enterprises . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> china has attracted foreign capital in successive years . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> gdp is the world 's most important macroeconomic indicators . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it is essential to sustain gdp growth throughout our country 's modernization drive . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> from now on china 's gdp per capita a percentage point , can stimulate more than 0.8 million people in employment , we must maintain the momentum of rapid economic growth . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> to build a welloff society in an allround way , the goal of the third step and the realization of the third step will depend greatly on the sustained rapid growth of gdp . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , we should see that gdp indicators are also defective . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> for example , it is not easy to accurately reflect the quality and structure of economic growth , and it is not easy to reflect the level of social benefits actually enjoyed by people and not accurately measure social distribution and social justice . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on the other hand , gdp is not the only one . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we assess the achievements , not only to see gdp growth , but also to see the real life of mass culture , the employment situation in this locality , social security and social justice , social order , social management and social cohesion . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> therefore , we should take scientific and scientific and scientific approaches to the existing system of gdp accounting , which is the position of gdp in the whole economic and social development . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we must not only maintain a certain rate of growth , but also fail to look too heavily , not only to be UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> since the council mission visited west africa at the end of june last year , while the situation in individual countries has been recurring , the overall situation in the region has been encouraging . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we are pleased to note that the government of sierra leone is making positive progress in enhancing the capacity of the military and the police , strengthening control over its diamond - based controls and organizing local government elections , and in accordance with established plans , unamsil is 
<EOS1> it is also gratifying that , with the deployment of unmil , liberia is emerging from the long - term impact of war - torn , and embarking on the road to recovery and reconstruction . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the political process in guinea - bissau had also made positive , and the transitional government had committed itself to legislative elections in march this year . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the peace process in cte d ' ivoire has undergone some setbacks and the parties committed to the implementation of the linas - marcoussis agreement , which the forces nouvelles announced to return to the government of national reconciliation . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we expect the council to take a decision as soon as possible . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the secretariat , ecowas and the parties concerned have also worked to address the cross - border issues of small arms , mercenaries , child soldiers in a regional perspective and achieve positive results . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> while fully affirming the progress made , we should see that the overall situation in the west african region remains vulnerable , particularly as a result of geopolitical and historical reasons that the countries of the region are closely linked and the situation is UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> as recommended in the report of the council , the international community , including the security council , must insist on a comprehensive and comprehensive strategy to address cross - border issues and strengthen its capacity to prevent and resolve conflicts while addressing cross - border issues . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we have a common understanding that children are the future of the world . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we have the duty to create the best and most appropriate conditions for them to live and learn from them so that they can grow , mature and succeed. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , it is regrettable that , in the current world , millions of children are still suffering from armed conflict . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> what they experience is unrest and backwardness . they see violence and destruction , which they suffer from injury and abuse , and what they feel is sadness and helplessness . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the protection of children from armed conflict is therefore a key responsibility of the international community . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> every country , especially the parties to the conflict , should make the greatest effort to do so . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we are pleased to note that in recent years , the united nations has taken a series of measures in recent years to promote the protection of children and children in armed conflict and have achieved positive results . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the council adopted successive resolutions UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK , UNK UNK and UNK UNK , which provide important frameworks for the protection of children . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the united nations peacekeeping operations deployed in some regions identified the protection of children as an important element , including the appointment of child protection advisers , taking into account the specific needs of children in the process of facilitating the disarmament , demobilization and reintegration process in the 
<EOS1> some of the peace agreements brokered or involved by the united nations contain provisions for the protection of children . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> national reconciliation is an important condition for the establishment of durable peace and stability in post - conflict areas . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> after the conflict stops , if the parties concerned fail to release their grievances , then the situation in peace will be difficult to consolidate , even if the flames of conflict may UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in many cases , national reconciliation , after the conflict , requires the joint efforts of the parties , and the support and assistance of the international community , particularly the united nations . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> over the years , the united nations has played a useful role in facilitating the process of national reconciliation processes in post - conflict countries and has accumulated a wealth of experience . we believe that , in general , it is essential that the united nations succeed in 
<EOS1> to take into account recent needs and long - term goals . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> national reconciliation often requires a certain process , it is difficult to be done overnight . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> different stages should be different in different stages . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> to promote national reconciliation , first of all , there is a need for first - hand UNK of former combatants and the creation of a secure environment . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at this stage , efforts to achieve the disarmament , demobilization and reintegration of ex - combatants are essential. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we are pleased to note that the situation in bosnia and herzegovina is becoming more and more stable , with the further easing of national relations and economic reconstruction and the return of refugees to work . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the progress made in the peace process in bosnia and herzegovina has been hard won . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we wish to express our congratulations to the government of bosnia and herzegovina and the people of the people of bosnia and herzegovina and express our sincere hope that the parties of bosnia and herzegovina will continue to work hard to further strengthen mutual trust and cooperation and to 
<EOS1> we also note that the institutions and capacity - building at the country - level of bih remains further refined , and that the reform of the areas of justice , the police and the judiciary still faces challenges . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we believe that the high representative will do so in the first half of the year and that we support the work of the government of bosnia and herzegovina actively with the high representative . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> believing that , with the help of the international community , the people of bosnia and herzegovina will gain new achievements in building their country 's own country and embark on their path of independent development and thus achieve the goal of integration into europe . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the peace and stability of bosnia and herzegovina is essential for achieving lasting peace and development in the region . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> china has been concerned with the development of the situation in bosnia and herzegovina and will continue to contribute , together with the international community , to help bosnia and herzegovina achieve their economic and economic development . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> china appreciates the efforts of the counter - terrorism committee to promote national implementation of resolution 1373 , and to help strengthen the capacity building of developing countries to counter terrorism . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the same time , we hope that the counter - terrorism committee will intensify its efforts to counter terrorism and strive to meet the practical demands of developing countries . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at present , the committee on the revitalization of the counter - terrorism committee is of concern . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> after repeated consultations , the counter - terrorism committee submitted a formal report and circulated as a document of the council . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the current structure and modus operandi of the counter - terrorism committee , through more than two years of practice , did not reveal adequate structures and methods of operation , such as the reporting burden of member states and the high level of conference and documentation , and 
<EOS1> we therefore fully support the necessary reform of the counter - terrorism committee , and we agree with the report of the counter - terrorism committee on the implementation of a package of programmes , and we hope that these issues will be addressed as quickly as possible , 
<EOS1> here , i would like to emphasize that the revitalization and reform process is an ongoing process and that , in any case , the counter - terrorism committee should be guided and guided by the counter - terrorism committee . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in recent years , the issue of small arms has been closely followed by the international community . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this suggests that the growing awareness among parties of the excessive accumulation of small arms and the illicit trafficking of small arms on the stability , post - war reconstruction and social development of the regions and states concerned has been increasingly recognized. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> fortunately , the united nations has taken a series of effective actions to address this issue . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in 2001 , the firearms protocol thereto and the united nations programme of action on small arms , annexed to the united nations convention against transnational organized crime , were concluded. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the legal and policy rationale for the proper resolution of the small arms issue demonstrates the determination of the international community to combat the illicit trade in small arms . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the past three years , the international community has made considerable progress in promoting the entry into force of the firearms protocol and in the implementation of the programme of action , in particular the successful convening of the first united nations first biennial meeting on small arms 
<EOS1> resolution 58 / 241 , adopted at the current session of the general assembly , decided to set up a working group to negotiate an international instrument for the identification and tracing of illicit small arms , which would undoubtedly further advance the efforts of the international community to 
<EOS1> likewise , the council has increasingly attached importance to the issue of small arms and has conducted on numerous occasions and adopted relevant presidential statements and resolutions . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> moreover , the council stresses the importance of addressing the issue of small arms when considering a range of issues relating to the protection of civilians , women and children in conflict . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> development of the economy and poverty eradication are essential preconditions for achieving sustainable development . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the sustainable development of the economy is the material base of environmental protection and overall progress in society . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> if we do not solve the problem of survival , we will not be able to develop and talk about sustainable development . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> promoting economic development and striving to eradicate poverty are the only way for developing countries to move towards sustainable development . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the development of developed countries was unsustainable in solving the problems of poverty in developing countries . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> rational utilization of resources and the protection of the environment are necessary requirements for realizing sustainable development . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the expense of wasting resources and the sacrifice of the environment , development is unlikely to continue . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> natural resources are not inexhaustible , but the demand for human development is increasing , if the relationship between the two sides is inappropriate , the deterioration of the ecological environment will lead to the survival and development of mankind . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> sustainable development can be realized only through a revolving economy that is based on the most effective utilization of resources and the protection of the environment . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the goal of sustainable development is to achieve the overall progress of the society and improve the living standard and quality of the people . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> a year ago , the ninth apec leaders ' informal meeting was held on the banks of huangpu river , shanghai , where the situation was still pending . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> today we meet on the other side of the pacific ocean of UNK UNK , UNK UNK UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> he was delighted to meet old friends . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i would like to take this opportunity to express my sincere gratitude to the president of the republic of mexico for his gracious invitation and the well - appointed arrangement of the mexican government . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> over the past year , the trend of economic globalization has continued and the rapid progress of science and technology has brought new opportunities for development . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the same time , the uncertainty in global economic development , including in some countries and regions , including apec members , faced new challenges in the economic development process . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> there is still a long way to go to achieve free , fair and fair trade in trade protectionism . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the struggle against terrorism is difficult and complicated , while non - traditional security factors have increased. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> our world is still very peaceful . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> despite the fact that the international community is still confronted with the problems that may arise in the future , the trend of the times of peace and development is irreversible and that the aspirations of peoples to live a better life do not change . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the dialogue was marked by the development of the dialogue , which was meaningful . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> development is the foundation of progress in human civilization and the key to solving the problems and problems confronting the world . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> only through global coordination , balance and universal development can we achieve lasting peace and stability in the world . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we should thoroughly discuss this topic and work together to solve this problem . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the trend of economic globalization has become one of the most striking features of the world economy . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> with the push of economic globalization , the links between countries and regions are becoming more and more open , and the flow of finance , technology , talent and so on is more and more extensive and faster . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the same time , the development of the trend of economic globalization posed severe challenges , widening the gap between the north and the south , the risk of being further marginalized , the increased risk of economic and financial risks and serious transnational crime . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at a time when this opportunity and challenge coexist , we should seize opportunities , confront challenges and work together , expand cooperation and promote economic globalization towards the achievement of common prosperity . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK international , president of south korea 's president , said north korea made progress . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> despite the influence of the nuclear issue , the korean - korean relations have made progress in the past year , and this year south korea will continue to build a solid security and security environment . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at a new year 's press conference on change , stability and hope , which was held at the presidential palace in UNK , the south korean countries all developed the strategic and plan for the peace of the korean peninsula . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> despite the impact of the nuclear issue , the north - south talks in 2003 held 38 times , and the number of north - south dialogues reached 106 days , indicating that the relations between the north and the south had slipped quietly in the past year , 
<EOS1> this year south korea will also continue to build on the security and security fundamentals of the north - south relations of the north - south relations , to resolve the korean peninsula nuclear issues will continue . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> if the nuclear issue is resolved , the rok relations will have the opportunity to turn a UNK UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the same time , the government of korea will focus on developing the economy in the new year , creating jobs , stabilizing the financial and real estate market , promoting social relations and improving the competitiveness of the industry . <EOS2>

<EOS1> in less than a month after the chinese new year , china has had three major security incidents , killing dozens of people each time . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the high frequency of accident occurred , and the loss of life was staggering . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the past few months , UNK accidents in the natural gas pipeline in chongqing , the gas explosion in several mines and frequent UNK accidents have led to hundreds of deaths . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the vast majority of china 's population , the population density , the probability of disasters more than other countries , will lead to several dozens of people , or even hundreds of people dead , which is objective conditions is the reality . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , in general sense , china 's death accident is too frequent . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in many disasters , the fire , coal mine explosion , firecrackers and passenger traffic accidents are numerous . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the very least , at least two problems , one of which is the weakest of these security measures , is that people do not learn from the tragic events of the past , thereby UNK the same type of accident . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the time of singapore 's rapid economic growth , there had been a serious incident of fire , which remains deeply rooted in its tragic memory , but is rapidly raising awareness of the security of singapore in public places . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> china is now in a very high economic and social transition period . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this number is not high enough in the local job , although the relative security environment in which the maid is working in the family is far from the nature of the accident . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> according to the information , in the period from january 1999 to june 2003 , a total of 99 nationality maids were killed in the accident . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> behind these figures is a broken - up family who is not supposed to be able to find her daughter and his mother coming home , and one should avoid the worst , but at the same time , we must try our best to reduce the number of 
<EOS1> according to the UNK issued recently by the indonesian embassy , in 1999 , 96 indonesian domestic workers died when working in singapore , some of which died when they were working . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the government , from time to time , expressed dissatisfaction on the floor of the UNK and , on a number of occasions , had enacted new regulations to tighten up the quality of local indonesian maids and to guarantee the safety of the maids . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it is a matter of deep confusion that the girl was born with a higher number of casualties than the casualty figures in the construction site , which had to be thought and necessary . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the taiwan affairs expert at home and abroad , the mainland chinese mainland , has recently published a survey of taiwan . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> most of the texts recorded in the book were written by taiwan 's first political party in march 2000 , and as at the end of march , chen shui - bian pointed out that he was the author of taiwan 's internal situation and cross - straits relations 
<EOS1> two years ago , two years later , the thesis was published , which was a long and arduous process of reviewing taiwan 's research literature theory . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> for a long time , UNK has been constantly seeking truth from facts and seeking truth from facts and seeking truth from facts and seeking truth from facts . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this feature was particularly impressive after the book was written . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the early 1980 s , the study of the taiwan issue became the UNK of the mainland , and various research institutions emerged and various scholars and experts emerged and emerged from the early 1980 s . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> abroad , people in the mainland are generally divided into northern and south UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the position of the north points is close to the government 's official rhetoric , with more aggressive hawks in certain historical stages or significant political developments . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the south branch of the taiwan authorities , broadly distributed in the yangtze south , including shanghai , fujian and other places . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> japanese prime minister UNK UNK studied in london for two years at the university of london , where he was exposed by japanese media . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> japanese newspaper weekly UNK confirmed at the university of london that mr koizumi spent nine months in the united kingdom alone in the school of UNK , without any degree . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this scandal has been reported or reproduced by china 's domestic and foreign media outlets , giving the vast majority of our countrymen . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> indeed , the prime minister of one country actually fabricated false educational records and deceived the national people . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this is particularly shameful in the japanese empire of UNK UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but if we can change a different point of view , there may be some positive implications for the scandal. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> moreover , these positive things are precisely what we lack and what we need to consummate . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in recent years , we have promoted the honesty and credibility of the government of the people 's republic of china , in order to strengthen the reputation of the government of the public . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> you think , a country of prime minister UNK UNK UNK , it is not so big , but can be exposed by the media , and UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in a country like this , there is nothing to UNK the sun 's rays . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> taiwan 's election potential party , the major camp will be used by the masses to send people to the public , but the recent situation is that lu hong bao 's evening party , obviously , a lot . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> recently , the president chen shui - bian was anxious to see half of his family 's friends and relatives in his speech at a summit meeting in the north . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> if there is no accident , taiwan 's presidential election in the countdown to enter the countdown , from the polls to the ground and so on the signs , should be assumed that the UNK will fail . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> unless the plot to explode , such as a scandal over a major split or worse scandal , has made it hard for chen shui - bian , who has proven his inability to win over the past four years , to weaken the confidence of supporters . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the face of possible re - governing of the pan - blue force , beijing should see how the UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> first of all , it should be understood that the pan - UNK , who might be in power , is not simply a party to the kuomintang , but rather a UNK , as well as internal tradition and local traditions . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> close cooperation in the period of election is not regarded as the inevitable relation of the future . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> if we choose to win , we will need time for internal integration , and immediately after the end of the election , it will be very difficult for the political power of the song dynasty , making too much change . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> unless it is aware that the improvement of cross - strait relations can be the political UNK in taiwan , and it is safe to deliver results within a short period of time , it is important that this outcome be felt by the public . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on the basis of this background , beijing should postpone the actions of UNK to consolidate the internal situation of the leaders of the UNK UNK UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> more than half a century had passed since the united states launched its first nuclear explosive in new mexico in july 1945 and launched two nuclear bombs into japan in august of that year . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> despite the arms race of the two super - powers in the u . s . and the soviet union , it is fortunate that both sides have recognized the dangers of nuclear war and that the nuclear button is avoided by both sides . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the aftermath of the collapse of the soviet union and the post - cold - war era of the world , the risk of massive nuclear war was largely eliminated. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but at the same time , the risk of nuclear proliferation is not diminishing but increasing . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this proliferation is manifested in two ways . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> first , some countries with considerable resources and strength are seeking to manufacture and possess nuclear weapons for the purpose of regional domination , the preservation of the security of their neighbours and the promotion of diplomatic diplomacy . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> another group of non - state organizations , particularly those with strong hate to the west , is also seeking small - scale nuclear weapons at the expense of innocent people and fighting bloody terror in the west . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> under this demand , the black and white markets of nuclear weapons and related technology transfer and the sale of nuclear weapons have appeared in the black market of the nuclear industry , and the scale of the nuclear weapons and related technologies is becoming an important part of 
<EOS1> as a growth in the UNK region , the old jiangnan rural scene with the impression that farmers living , still remain in my memory . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> after years of UNK back to his hometown , he found the green fields along the hangzhou - hangzhou expressway , dotted with three - story buildings built by farmers , but rarely seen people working in the field . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i am so surprised that i find it difficult to believe that such a great change will occur in our UNK , still attached to the UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but recently , from the internet to see some of the country 's rural situation and scholars on the investigation report , it is very unexpected and shock . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> unable to imagine the existence of such unimaginable dark side still in rural china , chinese farmers have lived a UNK and struggling life . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the chinese rural survey published by the UNK in rural areas of anhui , henan , and hebei province , which was published in china 's rural survey , was a shock to the chinese community . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> from the fact that they have been crushed by the farmers and killed by innocent people , they reached the conclusion that , as we approach china , we feel unprecedented , that we cannot imagine the less . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this is really a UNK of blood . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK , prime minister UNK of malaysia announced the day before yesterday announcing the dissolution of the congress , which will be held in the near future . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> for UNK , this election will be a significant event in the political life of the country , and the result of this election is symbolic of what malaysia and its developments are . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK took over leadership from UNK in november , up to four months . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> still , he decided to dissolve the congress ahead of the general election . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at least there are two things at least : one is satisfied with the government 's performance over the past four months , and he hopes to consolidate his power base by trying to consolidate his power base and thereby UNK itself . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> there is no doubt that the decisions taken by UNK to conduct the lightning - free elections reflect his overall assessment of the domestic political situation . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the current economic situation of the UNK is good and there is no issue that can be UNK and exploited by opposition parties . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> not only that , UNK has taken some high - profile initiatives on corruption , including the arrest and prosecution of former land and co - workers in UNK , the former minister of land and cooperatives . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the same time , he called for improved civilian service efficiency , which was also encouraging . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> since its inception , the european union has been influenced by the political and cultural influence of france and culture . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in diplomacy , independent and independent , the attitudes and ways of dealing with world affairs are different from the united states , which is the direction of european foreign policy . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this is why the international community , including china , russia and the arab countries , wants to see the rise of the european union and hope to see a completely independent force in international exchanges . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it must be admitted that the eu has been working in that direction since the end of the 1980 s . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in december 1992 , the heads of state of the european union agreed at the summit of the UNK summit that all member states would implement unified foreign policy in order to speak with the same calibre . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , two years later , in the context of addressing bosnia and herzegovina , the first diplomatic policy of the so - called UNK was completely UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> from the UNK summit until today , the ten - year eu diplomacy could be said to be UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in particular , the foreign policy of the european union is far from the test of events . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the different positions taken by member states to the u . s . - iraq war attest not only to this , but also to the european union 's political fatal flaw , which is easily broken by other powers and UNK by other powers . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on 24 february , president bush announced in the white house that he would support the constitutional amendment to ban same - sex marriage . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this was a significant change in the debate over the months of the united states , representing the important development of the political year of the us elections . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the constitutional amendment to the same - sex marriage is a very powerful political weapon in the u . s . s . s emerging base , but it also has a great negative effect , that in the u . s . , this is a UNK of 
<EOS1> for the election in 2000 , mr bush , who announced himself as a champion of unity in his own country , was not much of the UNK of mr bush 's UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in addition , the u . s . younger generation 's stand on gay issues is becoming more and more open , as a result of the short - term effect of the bush campaign , which will hurt the longterm interests of the republican party . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> president bush 's new constitution of the new year - old president of the u . s . president george w . bush . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> bush has taken this strategy because he is becoming increasingly vulnerable to the problems of war and economy - employment in the war on terror and in the economy - and has been forced to open up new battlefield on religious cultural issues in the country . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the attitude of the united states has been prudent so far . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in other words , due to the current situation in the taiwan strait , the u . s . should avoid the political and military conflicts with china because of its encouragement of taiwan independence . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> can see , the united states can not fully follow beijing 's requirements , completely eliminate taiwan 's referendum space , but because of its own interests , it will also take some warning action . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> recently , secretary of state colin powell has taken the initiative to reaffirm the established policy of the u . s . against taiwan independence . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the statement is interpreted by the outside world as intended to deter and prevent chen shui - bian . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> some of the latest statements by some u . s . politicians with official background , as well as the u . s . will be sending a large number of spies into the strait of taiwan to spy on military developments on the taiwan straits , have proved 
<EOS1> from another point of view , the u . s . will not completely stop taiwan holding the referendum at the request of beijing , but also worried about the uncertainty of the situation during the period . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> any large or one - to - one election can only result in a result , or the president - lien chan is re - elected or re - entered the presidential palace in taiwan . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the concern is that people from all walks of life in mainland china do not yet have a psychological preparation for chen shui - bian who is still unlikely to be able to win the information . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> if the election results are not intended , it will put beijing again into unnecessary passive situation . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK said the day - long confusion was more terrible than that of one thousand years ago . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this is what the northeast asian country is worried about today ? <EOS2> 
<EOS1> i think the answer is yes . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> a well - known research and development centre near washington , d . c . , has addressed the four decision - making choices of the north korean nuclear crisis in a recent study , namely contacts , UNK , economic sanctions and preemptive attacks . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the attitude of regional countries to these strategies is the focus of the survey . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in addition , the survey also analysed the threat posed by the north korean nuclear weapons programme , based on the possibility and destruction of the nuclear attack by its neighbours . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> china and russia feel that north korea is less dangerous or low to use nuclear weapons , and koreans in japan and south korea see a considerable risk . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> all north - east asian nations agree with north korea . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> while japan supported UNK , others believed that the UNK strategy was acceptable in some cases . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> singapore is very concerned about the international ranking , one year to the head of the european and european agencies to launch all kinds of national ranking list . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the top of the world , it also increases our attention to rank . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but the first is a lot of trouble . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> people in general feel that too much attention to the ranking appears to be afraid of losing , highlighting their ranking is proud . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> people said that we should live more UNK and better be able to be UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> because many people have been too UNK in the past , there is a wonderful phenomenon that people seem to be more inclined to take this as an embarrassing event than the first week of the world . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , over the past two years , the situation has changed again . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> we are skeptical of the long - term competitiveness of our country , and people in all walks of life worry about their jobs . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> there is a doubt that we will not be so UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> international competition is fierce , excessive UNK may lead to others , and it is easy to turn into everything . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on the face of the president bush 's UNK to cheney , george bush , at the end of last month 's republican congress , vowed that cheney was a vice - president . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but he also joked that , as in 2000 , he had appointed cheney to find a vice president for him . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK has been keeping a low profile in recent days , the media has visited the media , denied will be replaced. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but he kept the steps for himself . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> he said that if he got out of health problems or felt like he was the president 's negative , he would have been killed. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> cheney , 63 , has a record of four heart attacks . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> recently , the u . s . troops in the u . s . have been trapped in the first half of the year round , just waiting to be UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the presidential election , which was voted on 2 november , was said to have arranged the UNK of UNK in october . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but UNK , in case UNK became a UNK , instead of a UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it seems that mancini is a trump card for president bush 's fight for winning votes . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the president of the u . s . presidential election in 2004 has identified the democratic nominee for president george bush . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> they started a warm - up campaign before the november election to advertise and campaign debates . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> they may go around the war , the economy and the society . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> bush says war is close to the u . s . national security relations UNK saddam and terror , both in order to ensure u . s . security , so he told singaporeans that we are in war . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> mr UNK would point out that mr bush 's misuse of iraq 's wrong information on weapons of mass destruction is not a war for iraq . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> speaking of the economy , mr bush says mr. bush 's tax cuts are good for the rich and cannot create new jobs . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> bush called rick the current u . s . economic data does not go up , UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> social issues , men and women relations , bush opposed marriage , the opposition abortion , the death penalty is also opposed to marriage also against gay marriage , but pro abortion , against the death penalty . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> mr bush and mr kerry give their views on the three big issues , through advertising , television , speeches , and convincing voters that the next eight months will be the political show they play . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , in diplomatic subjects , there is room for large - acting acting . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> according to the data , young people who choose to commit suicide are among those aged 15 to 19 years old , but also young teens aged 10 to 14 . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it is generally believed that school stress is the cause of suicide among children and teenagers , but the study found that feelings of affection , especially the love between men and women , and the problems of living with their parents are the main causes of local youth 
<EOS1> the fall in stress and expectation is also part of communication between parents and children . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the pressures of higher learning are a long - term and unavoidable burden for local school students , sometimes when they are pressed for themselves . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> parents asked for good results , easy to take other children compared to other children , asking children to be pregnant , though not too small pressure , but behind the pressure of the channel and communication channels , is a measure of UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> if the child 's performance is not satisfactory , the parents should be scolded by the parents or poor ones as silent , or even let the children think they are disappointing , and undoubtedly pushed the child to the hopeless UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it is known that many young students who need counselling are forced into the dead by their parents ' high expectations and suffer from mental distress . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the success and rapid growth of singapore has made parents feel that things are better than in the past , and that children should be better off than they did. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> often , when parents forget they are still children , the various aspects of the performance may not be particularly good . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the age of one year and a half , most of the children were sent to the nursery of the agencies of the UNK system , where the authorities simply took a little care fee and a month or a month before coming home . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> today , singapore is confronted with a decline in fertility and social problems of population ageing . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> younger generations of materials that sustain the standard of living and fashion in the modern world still have energy to respond to the government 's early marriage calls for early marriage . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the author has a bold recommendation : the government come forward to accept new children . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> singaporeans just live , not to worry about raising problems . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on the one hand , the government has set up the UNK kindergartens kindergarten and converted to full - time , or even three - meal services , in token of payment of citizens ' affordable payment . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it can not only solve the employment problems of the unemployed , but the government has no need to worry about the success of the UNK , the increase in maternity leave , the quality of the maid , the tax rebate , etc. <EOS2> 
<EOS1> beijing needs to do so , not only to act as the leader of the six - party talks , but also to focus on china 's long - term interests in the korean peninsula , take a proactive plan and start early strategic deployment . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in particular , on the one hand , beijing must encourage north korea to abandon its nuclear armed forces , on the other hand , starting with the reform of the regime of kim jong il on the road of modern civilization . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> pyongyang , UNK , is eager for developing the economy and integrating into the international community . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> only this desire is manifested through strong , irrational , sometimes even complete non - conformity with international rules . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in fact , for some time , beijing has made use of clout and UNK to force pyongyang to change its stance on international rules . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but this action still needs UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> beijing 's aid to pyongyang should not be confined to the economic sector , but should extend to other sectors of the society , not confined to pyongyang 's nuclear programme , but more aimed at bringing it to modern civilization . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> rick came into the arena at first , and no one was bullish about him , when all the focus was on the governor of vermont . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but in january , before the UNK meeting in UNK , UNK , UNK , won the most crucial two - state and new hampshire conference and the new hampshire . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> at the beginning of the rest of the state , rick did not have a UNK , and those UNK states were because the state had their own candidates . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK spent only six weeks in an almost never - promising candidate , including UNK , UNK , clark , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK , UNK and UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> during his 19 - year - old senate career , mr kerry has supported abortion and environmental policies , which oppose tax breaks that benefit the rich and work to raise the minimum wage and to address global warming . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> his work in washington demonstrated his willingness to face social problems and to challenge authority and to take courage into the interests of small groups . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> china 's reform and opening policy began with agriculture , which was the first beneficiary of this policy . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , after the 1990 s , as economic policies were greatly skewed to cities , agricultural reform was largely stagnant and the gap between urban and rural areas was increasing . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> over time , china has presented two distinct worlds , one is a city with a high level of prosperity and a poor country . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in china 's official words , the widening gap between the rich and poor in china and the countryside is a problem in the development of UNK , so it is still necessary to solve them . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in other words , china 's coastal areas and cities should continue to develop and should not suffer from rural problems . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but when you see some big cities that change dramatically in the first year of a year , people wonder why some impoverished areas have had nothing to change for decades . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> of course , the development pathways in the rural and urban areas are very different , and the fact that it should be acknowledged is that 70 per cent of the country 's population is concerned and valued at the time of putting substantial investment into urban construction , 
<EOS1> in theory , chinese governments have paid no attention to agriculture , rural and peasant issues . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> however , the increasing difficulties and deterioration of rural situations in the years that have led to an increasing degree of scarcity in their focus . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in any country , the public , the prosecution , the law should be justice , just a symbol of justice , but also the most important guarantee of social stability . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> unfortunately , the public , the prosecution and the law have become a symbol of corruption in china . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the recent report of the national audit office said the results of a review of the financial spending of the municipal public security authorities in 26 provinces last year showed that the number of national public security officials amounted to 16.5 billion yuan . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the crisis of trust in the public , the prosecution and the law has been UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the events of UNK , UNK and recent UNK events all reflect this deep distrust . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the UNK UNK event is more typical . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the concern for this issue is far more than the concern of the sars epidemic during the period of sars . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in fact , the concern is not over the UNK events per se , but the lack of faith in the entire justice system . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the authorities are very well aware of this and therefore take a campaign against the media shortly . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but the problem is still there . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the sixparty talks on the korean peninsula nuclear issue ended in a widely expected outcome . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> during the talks , the parties contacted and explored the issue of the peninsula nuclear crisis and reached a consensus on matters such as the third round of talks and the establishment of a working group on the peninsula . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> but there is no progress on how north korea should give up its nuclear weapons development programme , how to ensure north korea 's political and military security and offer energy assistance to north korea after north korea abandons its nuclear programme . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> north korea and the united states did not show any compromise , nor did the basic positions of the two sides UNK <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it is striking , however , that the united states , in this meeting , has shown an unwillingness to resolve the problem and give an impression of UNK . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the strategy that emerged from the united states was closely linked to the new development of the current international situation and the interests of its new developments . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> ever since roosevelt 's president , the united states has never seen so much corporate bosses . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it was a coincidence that the crime and other unlawful acts of the public and the investors had been intolerable for three years , and that the concentration of these crimes was concentrated in recent years . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the answer may not be simple , but the crime of many companies has been exposed lately . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> this is a good sign for economic recovery , especially restoring confidence in investment . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the late 1990 s may be one of the most chaotic and elusive stages in american business history , and the better it is going to die . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> UNK , some of the names of some companies will be limited to history , only at the end of the school textbooks can only be found . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> others , such as UNK and UNK , will seek to restructure the new round of economic growth , led by the new management team . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> when is the new round of economic growth coming from ? <EOS2> 
<EOS1> as ceo , you may not have an answer . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> that doesn't matter , because federal reserve chairman alan greenspan did not know the answer . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the bush administration wants to take the keynesian economy to stimulate the economy and boost spending , on the one hand , and , on the one hand , a surge in spending power , particularly in defense spending . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> on the international side , the bush administration continued to promote free trade , but the trade deficit reached $ UNK billion . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> after substantial tax cuts , there is no significant increase in investment and consumption . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> the UNK school , represented by the famous british economist UNK UNK , argues that the us economy is falling into trouble and that the financial and strategic outlook of george bush . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> they believe that the so - called law of the law of the market is only a fantasy , which leads to a small number of people , and most people suffer . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> people have previously thought that in the global context , so - called profitable minorities are in the united states , most of them in the developing world . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> now , that 's not true . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> many people in the united states believe that the winner of the current globalization , in addition to the united states as a base multinational companies , india and china are also prominent . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> india is in the economic sector , and china is in the manufacturing sector . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> people have focused on the large amounts of u . s . funds and production equipment transferred to china , but can not see the high - level , low - income labour market . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> first , taiwan UNK is in beijing estimated or outside beijing estimates . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> beijing how to estimate that only its own clear , but the estimated results , others can be considered publicly . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in the past four years , chen shui - bian and zhang UNK have been active in taiwan independence movements . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> in contrast , beijing , in addition to a high - tone , is close to the routine , and seems to have been UNK for taiwan independence . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> last autumn , however , it became quite different , as if the car had changed cars , and in several months it was evident that treatment was different from the 1990 s . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> it can be inferred that taiwan UNK is in its estimate . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> next , look at taiwan diplomacy . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> with regard to the situation of the taiwan straits , the attitude of the major countries in the united states is closer to beijing than in taipei . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> because of the country 's openness , the answer is clear . <EOS2> 
<EOS1> to date , countries and beijing are not only closer together , but also in particular , but also in taipei , with fewer UNK and less UNK of taiwanese democracy . <EOS2>
