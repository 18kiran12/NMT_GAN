<seg id=375>I'd like you to keep my bags for me.</seg>
<seg id=376>Don't be timid.</seg>
<seg id=377>Seven is good.</seg>
<seg id=378>My dentures aren't quite right.</seg>

<seg id=400>I'd like to get some Scotch tape.</seg>
<seg id=401>Happy to meet you.</seg>
<seg id=402>There you go.</seg>
<seg id=403>That's a pity. The game was such a close one.</seg>
<seg id=404>A motorbike came by me and the person grabbed my bag.</seg>
<seg id=405>Hi.</seg>
<seg id=406>Could I borrow your washroom, please?</seg>
<seg id=407>Where can I exchange this for foreign currency?</seg>

<seg id=444>It goes every twenty minutes.</seg>
<seg id=445>Excuse me but can you take a picture?</seg>
<seg id=446>Would you like coffee or tea?</seg>
<seg id=447>I'd rather be in the smoking car, if you would.</seg>
<seg id=448>Possibly it was stolen.</seg>
<seg id=449>That's good.</seg>
<seg id=450>Would we be able to go out to the lobby?</seg>
<seg id=451>I get it already.</seg>

<seg id=491>I'm not able to converse well.</seg>
<seg id=492>Please sketch a map here.</seg>
<seg id=493>I apologize. We have two sets of two seats in the no-smoking car, but not all together.</seg>

<seg id=50>The basic reason is that because they drive themselves to study so hard in high school and in university entrance exam prep schools, when they do get into the university, they are intent on enjoying the short time they have before joining the working world. People know that the lives of people who work in Japan are, in fact, no easy matter.</seg>

<seg id=302>My fin was washed away.</seg>
<seg id=303>I've just about given up on locating it.</seg>
<seg id=304>Is there an airport bus that I can catch into town?</seg>

<seg id=415>I reside in a condominium.</seg>
<seg id=416>Sort of like this.</seg>
<seg id=417>I'm sorry. I mistook you for a different person. Go ahead and go.</seg>

<seg id=432>Yes, it's usable.</seg>
<seg id=433>What about this one?</seg>
<seg id=434>I'm in need of some toilet paper.</seg>
<seg id=435>I'd be very interested in a room with a view.</seg>
<seg id=436>It's referred to as the "lifetime employment system" and it's a characteristic of the Japanese type of management.</seg>
<seg id=437>How much is it going to run?</seg>
<seg id=438>Please send it express.</seg>

<seg id=443>My gut hurts.</seg>
<seg id=444>There's one that goes every twenty minutes.</seg>
<seg id=445>Pardon me, but would you take a photo for us?</seg>
<seg id=446>Would that be coffee or tea?</seg>
<seg id=447>I'd rather have the smoking car, please.</seg>
<seg id=448>It could have been stolen.</seg>
<seg id=449>That's enough.</seg>
<seg id=450>Could we go out to the lobby?</seg>
<seg id=451>I realize that.</seg>

<seg id=449>That'll be fine.</seg>
<seg id=450>Is it okay to go out to the lobby?</seg>
<seg id=451>I'm aware of that.</seg>

<seg id=6>I'll cut the line.</seg>
<seg id=7>I've got chills.</seg>
<seg id=8>Can you let me off here, please?</seg>
<seg id=9>I'd like to get off here.</seg>
<seg id=10>Have you any sightseeing tours?</seg>
<seg id=11>The suitcase is a large blue one.</seg>

<seg id=16>Where would I find the opera house?</seg>
<seg id=17>Would it be possible to develop these rolls of film and get prints?</seg>
<seg id=18>Shall I give you a back rub?</seg>
<seg id=19>Next, please. Your passport and declaration form, please. Have you anything to declare?</seg>

<seg id=49>Would I be able to get a medical letter?</seg>
<seg id=50>I would say that it's mainly because they've had to work so hard in high schools and university prep schools that once they get into university they've decided that they're going to enjoy that short moment of freedom in their lives before entering the work force. People have no misconceptions about the harsh realities of working life in Japan.</seg>

<seg id=50>I guess the main reason for this is that it was necessary for them to study hard in high-school and prep school university exams, and so when they get to university they are resolved to enjoying a short rest in life before entering the working world.
